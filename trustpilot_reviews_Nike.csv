Barry Cox,"Purchased a pair of NikeID AirMax 90’s a while back kept them boxed up for quite a while as seemed too good to wear. I did eventually decide to wear them however when I washed them the white colouring came off, and this by applying very little pressure while rubbing the material.Contacted Nike but was told that there was nothing they could do as the guarantee had expired.",01 May 2024,GB
Paddy Coughlan,"An absolute mess of a company. Ordered new trainers and was sent a pair of used trainers with dirt on the soles and tied together. Customer service are a joke. Disconnected every time I mention the issue. No names of advisors provided either, convenient. Items will be sent back. I'm sure they'll mess the refund up as well. Useless.",30 April 2024,IE

Lukasz T.,"Be aware when ordering online from Nike UK. My parcel wasn't delivered and no one knows where is it. I contacted customer service several times over three days via chat and no one was able to help me. Their advisers only apologise ,switch off and refuse to provide contact details to make  official complaint. Absolute disgrace!",22 April 2024,GB

Mona Zeytter,"Imagine that Nike in Dubai is not willing to return or change  my daughter sneakers that I bought for my daughter for Eid just because the maid threw the box. I mean, they have no objection to me throwing away sneakers worth 550 dirhams, just for the sake of a box.I don’t know how a famous company like Nike has  a customer service that don’t try to find solutions for customers only telling them the formula of the policy only super disappointed",23 April 2024,AE
Mark Armstrong,Nike Air Vapourmax plus. Really thin material starting to perish and form holes. These trainers are super expensive and we're bought as a gift. Contacted Nike customer service and because there's no receipt or order number I have been told to enjoy my day.,24 April 2024,GB

Marcin Iwaszkiewicz,"@nike The worst customer service I have EVER experienced!!! Shocking for company that sells shoes for several hundreds of pounds. The ‘athletes’ or in other words incompetent call centre representatives, barely speak English and hang up on you whenever they want mid sentence. One of my items didn’t arrive and after what they call ‘thorough investigation’ they decided they will not give me refund and will not provide ANY proof of the said ‘thorough investigation’. I have requested manager phone call and have been waiting 3 weeks. I’ve sent the items that I have received back to them, with their return labels, I got tracking number to prove the parcel was sent back, yet they will not refund me for the items sent back and they are performing their once again ‘thorough investigation’ that is taking already 2 weeks. @nike have literally ripped me off and there’s no one to talk to which is very convenient for them!!! AVOID!!!",06 April 2024,GB
Jennifer Hoult,"Don't buy Nike.  They are a sexist organization that outfits women Olympians as porn bait instead of world class athletes.  Their outfits for male Olympians are a different story, which shows they actually know how to make serious athletic gear.  But for women, they just market porn.",13 April 2024,US
Simon Ling,"I have bought a pair of shoes (Price:£76.99) online  and paid by Nike gift card (GC) (Value: £77).  Unfortunately, I cannot full paid by using Nike gift card.  The system showed 'Sorry, we are unable to process your order. For more information, please call +44 (0) 2076604453 for help. [Code: 98D2586B ]'.I called 02076604453 by my phone.  However, the contact no. was changed.  (disappointed).Then, I live chatted with Nike.  The customer service told me '... and the reason why you are getting an error code is because you need to add payment method like Debit/Credit card as partial payment to fulfil the order.  This is known issue for Nike GC, we were unable to use one Nike GC to cover all the amount if we are placing an order at Nike.com or Nike app.'.  I was told 'we are not allowed to place an order for billing information security purposes.'.So. When you use Nike GC, don't full pay.",21 April 2024,GB
Jake,I usually get a new pair of AF1s every few years but the last pair just felt different. Not really sure what’s going on lately but the production just isn’t there for me.,16 April 2024,US
Anna,For a company that openly pride themselves on customer service and 100% stand by their product it’s the most poor I have experienced not to mention their ‘hate’ for landfill. Due to my shoes being out of its 2 year warranty they kept dodging my questions in relation to a fix to my defective shoes (never worn). Merely the insole has been stuck in the wrong place. They proceed to ignore my further questions of just replacing the sole and further advice and just keep leaving the chat. Nike needs a big wake up call and a lesson in manners .,12 April 2024,GB
Shannon,"I purchased two pairs of shorts for my husband on March 23, 2024 which he didn't like from the Nike at CrossIron Mills. I tried to return them to the Nike store in Chinook Mall but ALL PURCHASES TO CROSSIRON must be returned to that store (because they aren't affiliated) which is inconvenient. I wouldn't have purchased them at all had I known that since I live in Bragg Creek area. I called and Trevor (sales associate) said they'd send me a mailing label so I wouldn't have to pay for return shipping. The store received the shorts on April 6, 2024 and they still haven't refunded me the money.I would seriously reconsider shopping at this store unless you live in the NE or often frequent this store as returns and customer service are TERRIBLE.",06 April 2024,CA

FROM A LOCKER. They did not provide me with any code, which lockers usually require.Another support person said that the parcel has been returned to them. And then they abruptly ended the chat.Meanwhile DPD website showes the status of the package as ""Your parcel is on its way back to Nike"". Looks like the only chance to ge my money back is to claim refund from the credit card provider.Never ever again will I buy from Nike.",12 April 2024,GB
King Owens,Never receive packages ups gave Nike my refund Nike still not trying to pay me back they keep hanging up on me as soon as ups get on phone I had two of Nike customers service rep tell me I'm getting my refund back but when I called cause I never received it Nike tell me their employees was lying I can't let over 500.00 money just go I'll never order from them ever again They are stealing from us,11 April 2024,US

Howard,Made contact with Nike customer service after running shoes bought from online retailer were faulty. Online retailer was no help so as Nike are manufacturer wanted some help. Was spoken to by Eylul who refused to give any meaningful supporrand claimed to be unable to give me any further support even as the manufacturer of the running shoes.

LARS BøTKER FARSø,"Several times lately - I have experienced to order goods from Nike.com that never arrives. You get several mails that order is just a bit delayed, and then 2-3 weeks in your order is suddently cancelled ""out of the blue"" - due to ""out-of-stock"". But when you then return to the site, you can still order the same product in same sizes!? This has never happened before. I've been a returning customer for many years, so this is very dissapointing. Hope someone at Nike will take ownership to fix what ever is wrong with their website.",28 March 2024,DK

MAR,"Bought Nike Air for my son, they were never worn as the Air was too soft which made them uncomfortable.  MEMO TO SELF! NIKE AIR IS RUBBISH.  However I should have complained within the 2 year warranty while I didn't realise.   I'm out of warranty but it is just a dreadful brand these days.  Perhaps the Higher End is better made but as my kids  feet are growing so fast I don't want to throw too much money on shoes.  But what I bought was utter rubbish.",01 April 2024,IE

jamie cooper,"Who signed off on the idea of changing the St George’s flag on the England shirt .Absoloute disgrace , imagine changing the Italian colours there would be an uproar but it’s okay we have to be inclusive .There’s been no issue for the past 100 years and more of having the flag.By Like changing the colour of the flag do Nike and the fa think this will not drive people away from buying it, do they think if we say we’re more inclusive more people will buy the shirt we’re as had we kept it the same maybe less people would of bought it .What is the world coming to , too many snowflakes and soft touches !",22 March 2024,GB

Arabelle R,"I received a product that was not the same as the photo. The team member offered me 10% if I wanted to keep the bottle. I told them that my son was disappointed as he wanted the product as shown on the picture. The team member told me to return this product and they will send me new product. They sent me a return label however I told them I do not have a printer and I asked if this can be printed at the postcode office. They said yes. When I received the email it did not show any options of printing at the post office, so I spoke to the chat team again and explained if they can send me a barcode as I did not have a printer for the label. They told me there is no other option but to print the label and advised me that I can go to the library and print it.Why should I go waste my time to go and print a label when it was not my fault Nike sent a product that was not the same as the product image. Also my son had to wait another few days for another product to arrive.This is shameful for their customer service team to advise their customers this way! Also they dispatched the exchanged product using royal mail to a pick up location as if it is my own home address. I assumed the person who did the exchange will resend it the exact same way I ordered it, not presume the pick up shop is my home address! They did not confirm my address with me.I had issues collecting my order from the shop as I did not have any pick up pass.I tried to submit a complaint to them on the chat and they just closed the chat. Disgusting customer service",16 April 2024,GB
David Turner,I like the brand personally but the design of the New England football kit is awful - no colour through the kit - fabric looks like a roll of Wallpaper- a white star on a white background? Above the badge ????  Designed in 5 minutes obviously. Price is too much for the worst England kit ever in my opinion.,23 March 2024,GB
Pablo brown,Nike And SNKRS This organisation do not believe in matching the high prices with common sense delivery packaging. Just paid £144.99 for a pair on Nike Air OG 86 Royal Blue. The item comes in two boxes the main box that holds the item and a secondary box which the main item fits inside as the secondary box has no protective padding what so ever and it fits like a glove round the main item when the outer box is damaged and it will get damaged so will the main item. Nike know about this and do nothing to change this even after the components they have received so this item is now being returned.,25 March 2024,GB

I’m petite like 5’0 105 and I got the size that I usually wear, but these were very narrow where it was uncomfortable. They’re not for the gym because I got several blisters. Mainly on my pinky toes and the tongue of the shoe. They look like they’re going to be comfortable, but they’re very hard on your feet. Don’t let the AirMax bubble fool you. These shoes were made for light walking, not for comfort.",24 March 2024,US

FB,"Customer service is awful.  Went to Oxford Street store and was ignored by groups of staff huddled together chatting and ignoring customers.  The 'athlete' (OP 456459) on the till  kissed his teeth as I walked towards him. There was no one else at that till and it clearly a huge inconvenience to him to do what he was being paid to do. He ignored me throughout the transaction, pointed at the card machine rather than asking me to enter my card.   Arrogant, rude, horrible.   I phoned customer service to ask how to make a complaint and I was told ' I don't have a clue how you do that'.  I then went into text chat and spent half an hour talking to someone who was argumentative, lied and clearly did not have a clue what she was doing.

Beverley Griffiths,"My Grandson wears size 14 trainers. His father ordered a pair which was supposed to have arrived on December 15th 2023. They didn't arrive! According to Nike, the system says they arrived. THEY DIDN'T!

Rebecca Walker,"The customer service at Nike are appalling. I was reaching out regarding some faulty Vapormax that I bought from JD Sports. I paid cash and misplaced the receipt. I started a chat with a 'nike athletic' who ended the chat before I was finished explaining my concerns. So I called 020 7660 4453. To be greeted by someone even ruder. She cut me off everytime I spoke, talked over me and was laughing along with her colleagues. I was providing my address and the spelling before I finished she shouted GOT IT! Nike must hire the most obnoxious rude arragant people known to man. What a horrible person.",29 February 2024,GB
Karen Martins,"I ordered a pair of trainers on 08.03.24 that haven't been received and are lost by the courier service. I checked with Nike on the15.03.24 because I hadn't received it. Turns out Nike were not tracking courier, so were unaware of the non-delivery, nor can they do anything about the courier.  So because Nike cannot locate the package and told me I have to come back to them next week for a possible refund.",15 March 2024,GB
Mrs.RH,"Excellent company, I had a fault with a pair of trainers, spoke to Nike online chat and returned back to them with no problems.

ellen fordham,"Must remember to not do Christmas shopping with this company. Start shopping early so you can hopefully grab it before it goes out of stock, but then if it doesn’t fit, and that’s more often than not with Nike sizing, you can’t return it because it’s gone over their returns duration, even though they’re still selling the items on line. Also can guarantee you have to chase a refund when you return an item. 3 weeks been waiting, and tracking says they have had it for weeks. Have had an account and been a good customer of Nike for a long time but their customer service is truly shocking.",19 January 2024,GB

Lucy,"Ordered some items from Nike and DPD delivered it to the wrong address. Nike simply offered me a refund, no gesture of goodwill or anything considering the order was of a significant amount and was a Valentines Day gift. They didn’t even offer to send a replacement. They said they can only refund me, but the refund will take several days to process. So I had to spend the same amount again to order a replacement myself, before the refund has even come through! Terrible customer service.",10 February 2024,GB
Consumer,"Had to raise a chargeback via the credit card company against Nike today for an incorrect refund, attempted several time to discuss this with Nike directly, but each time the online person ended the chat or received emails from them contradicting themselves. It will cost Nike more to process the charge back claim from Amex than it would for them to rectify the issue. The over charge is £15, I’ve already used the online complaints 3 times as well as a phone call, I’ve downloaded the transcript from today and would upload it here as proof if there was an option! Now their finance team will have to trawl back through paperwork and orders etc. I’ve found the UK FD on LinkedIn so will drop him an email with the details.",18 February 2024,GB

Spoke via an overseas rep who was difficult to understand, similar convo, basically said they didn’t know what to say which is jolly helpful. He even went as far as telling my to find an internet cafe to see if they could print me a label Nike aren’t capable of sending, laughable.Refused to facilitate the return, this is ongoing as the are being ridiculous, lost a long time customer.Billion dollar company can’t produce a postage label to cover the return, incredible.",11 March 2024,GB
Sparra-Lee,"Was interested in a couple of designs online so decided to visit Nike town Oxford street to try on and decide. Women’s on 3rd floor - not sure why but I  finally got there. I asked member of staff for sizes but she was far too cool to be working and spoke very few words to me. Needed smaller sizes but staff were in groups chatting to each other and very hard to get their attention. I gave up and left vowing never to go back. I ended up getting some Adidas trainers which are great. Not sure if I’ll buy Nike again as my purchases keep people like that in a job! Very bad experience, Nike you make big bucks so get your act together.",02 February 2024,GB

RGolf,Order cancelled within hours of expected delivery date with the suggestion that there wasn't any stock. Funny how a company this size and with this much trading experience doesn't have live stock tracking. I went back on to re-order and low and behold the trainers are still showing in stock and available to purchase. Absolute joke,17 February 2024,GB
Nimi,"Would give this company zero stars if that was an option.  Their chosen courier lost my return package and they will not accept responsibility for this. I see no evidence that they have made an attempt to reach out to the courier to carry out an investigation. They just keep insisting that I will not get a refund unless they receive the package.  This is despite the fact that they have proof that It was picked up by their chosen courier. To make matters worse, on one of my calls to the company,  I had someone intentionally drop the phone on me after telling me she had  other people to attend to.

Next day try again, on PC, still didn’t work, yet they confirmed there was sufficient funds on the card, was then told the purchase has been blocked due to trying so managed times even though their advisor told me to try again numerous times on different devices. Apparently my issue was escalated and I would hear back. 48 hours later, heard nothing. I have managed to get a refund for the voucher but proving Nike wouldn’t accept it, closed and deleted my account with Nike and won’t be using them again!

Thanks Tim,"I purchased the first pair of Nike in several years and will never again. I purchased the Air Jordan 14 Retro Flint grey on 03/21/2024 and was suppose to arrive on the 25th. We it didn't I checked tracking and the only thing it showed was label created. Talked  to customer service and was informed UPS had package because they only bill your card when it shipped and my card was charged. Was told to give it a few more days which I did. A few days later same tracking, label created. I call customer service again and ask for a supervisor to get to bottom of shipping problem. Jackie was the supervisor, what a joke, Nike must promote the highest level of incompetency. Jackies answer, we can give you a refund because the shoe is now out of stock. I asked when they would be in stock, she said no idea and they might not be. I asked her to call UPS location to find out the problem and she refused. Then asked her what UPS location they were suppose to be located. She didn't want to say but I insisted and got a half A answer of Adapt MI that she guessed was Mississippi. Obviously there are thieves either at Nike or UPS.   With supervisors like Jackie Im sure Nike is getting  getting robbed blind. Makes perfect sense that Nike sprice on stock market is way down. Employees like Jackie will run any company in the ground. I wouldn't hire her to walk a dog. SMDH",21 March 2024,US

Christine PA,"They did not send a tracking number on my email and app. I waited for the estimated delivery date written on my confirmation email, until a day after where I contacted customer service. They said that the courier tried to deliver the parcel 4x and failed, so the parcel was returned to sender. I did not receive any calls from the courier. The 1st 2 customer reps I talked to assured me of the reshipment, but they lied. They actually started the refund process the 1st time I contacted customer service, even if I did not ask them to. Very poor service. I will not be ordering from this site again.",19 February 2024,PH
D M,"They have no control over their supply chain, their delivery partner DPD which is even worse than them refused to deliver my package due to some damage on the outer box, no evidence provided. The delivery partner has opted to send it back to Nike as Nike has a strict policy they can't deliver damaged parcels even though inner box and product was fine. Nike also have a policy where anything returned to them they won't reship. Bearing in mind this being returned become someone somewhere along the journey damaged it and I am not to blame. This item is limited and therefore won't be re released. They claim to have emailed DPD to tell them to deliver anyway but DPD don't care and can just send back your order even if you are happy to receive it. Been told someone will be in touch with me within a week via email.. shocking and ludicrous experience. The customer never wins",20 February 2024,GB

Ivo,"Terrible customer service and basically no warranty in Canada. I bought shoes from authorised Nike store. Now when you look for warranty, I tried chat service- not able to deal with it because it is not purchased from Nike direct! They refer you to Nike corporate, after 4 hours wait time, the 'athlete' is telling you to go to the shop and see what they could do!? I mean go and try to see…?!?! A shop that is 150km from home! So, in a word, Nike do everything to not honour the warranty- that I call exceptionally poor customer service, or lack of one in a single word! Definitely will consider my future purchases that is for sure.",13 February 2024,CA

I took them back to store and exchanged assuming that it was a faulty pair. When the new trainers arrived at my home 3 days later they already showed signs of holes at the front so I took them back again. I decided given two pairs had the same identical issues that I would not try again. Very poor quality for the price tag.",26 February 2024,GB

Nike refused to listen and also wouldn’t give any information on where it had been used and on what product. Their customer service was shocking and because of it they have lost the custom of a whole family because none of us will ever buy from Nike again !,22 February 2024,GB

I took them back to the retailer only to be told to contact NIKE direct. I have been trying now for a couple of weeks, sent them numerous emails, no replies.   Called them got put on hold after going through the automated services, ten minutes later still holding.  I have not been able to speak to anyone yet.

Amy,"Do not buy NIKE gift cards. We received four Nike $100 gift cards for Christmas that were purchased from Walgreens. These cards were printed with insufficient PIN numbers, per the NIKE outlet manager. The manager confirmed the balance, and said that we should call the 800 number and Nike would either re-issue the cards or provide an adequate PIN number in order to use the cards. Nike refused to honor gift cards and frauduantly zeroed the balance in order to do so. They said that the cards were used. This statement is inconsistent with the statement from the outlet manager, who said that the cards could not be used as issued, with only 4 numbers for the PIN. When pressed beyond the canned response about not being able to do anything for cards with a zero balance, they falsely reported that one of the cards was used at a store in the Bronx in December 2023. That was a fraudulent statement because the card was physically 1300 miles from there at that time. When I stated this inconsistency and asked for documentation of each card's alleged usage, they refused to disclose the information on the other two cards and would put nothing in writing. The customer service rep stated that I must go to local police and NIKE would provide information only if they received a subpeona.This dishonest business practice of refusing to honor gift cards by erasing the balance must be a standard operating procedure at Nike.",23 March 2024,US

I'm done shopping here I've wasted so much of my money with them its unreal. I wouldn't recommend nike to anyone. This is ridiculous for them to be that big of a company and do people this way.

Paid over $200 for the Jordans MVP 678 & the left pair from inside of the heel had a very bad defo was ripping apart from just wearing them like 2-3 times. Called for refund but explained the credit card I had used is no longer working and I'm looking to provide new banking details for the refund. They said yes no problem we put a note in the system before we process the refund will give you a call and sort it out. Called twice before they process refund because I knew they would like and that would happen and sure enough they sent me an email the refund has been processed to a bank I'm no longer with that I closed down. I called customer service very frustrated explaining that I called three times to make sure to call me beforehand and I was told ya so now I lost 5 business days for them to look Into it and every time I call they extend the process and give me hard time!!!! Lost 250$ and a pair of shoes these guys are unprofessional and very bad with giving a promise that they can't hold. Now they're telling me they can only return the refund to same CC AFTER ALL THIS HASSLE!!!

Despite this, the company has been unable to locate the parcel or is claiming that it arrived empty. Such treatment of customers is unacceptable for a reputable company.

Uzair Siddiqui,"I recently visited the Nike store in Manchester and, regrettably, my encounter with the manager, Avesta, left much to be desired. The service provided was cold and heartless, leading to a thoroughly disappointing experience.From the moment I stepped into the store, it was evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority. Avesta, the manager on duty, displayed a lack of empathy and failed to address my concerns adequately, leaving me feeling unheard and unappreciated as a customer.The overall atmosphere in the store felt tense, and it was disheartening to experience such a lack of professionalism from someone in a managerial position. Avesta's approach to customer service fell far short of the standards I expect from a brand as reputable as Nike.I believe that providing constructive feedback is crucial for improvement. I sincerely hope that Nike takes steps to address these issues, ensuring a more positive experience for future customers. Nike has a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and my encounter with Avesta was a disappointing departure from that expectation.I encourage Nike to invest in customer service training and create a more welcoming environment for patrons. As a loyal customer, I hope to witness positive changes in the service provided at this location in the future.This feedback is shared with the intention of contributing to the improvement of customer experiences at Nike, and I trust that steps will be taken to rectify these concerns.",17 February 2024,GB

As a customer who purchased a product through Nike. I'd expect Nike to deal with the issue and help me get the product I ordered or a refund instead of taking my money and then refusing to help.

Gonçalo Gomes,"I want to make this clear it is purely about the experience today with the website and phone support. Tried to purchase 2 pairs of shoes, at checkout I ended up getting all sorts of errors, despite choosing different payment methods (paypal, google pay) - the error did have a phone number which was actually a smart thing to include. Getting through to an operator was less than an easy task. I understand the more info you have, the speedier you get the operator to help us and more efficient your support is, but having a robot trying to ""note down"" my name, was anything but a easy task. In the end, I gave up and used John Smith. After that, I was quite fast speaking to Radha in India, who was polite and knowledgeable, but unfortunately, I could barely hear word and had to ask her to repeat herself countless times. Please improve the experience. Furthermore, the solution was to install the app or wait 24 hours, which I was reluctant to do, but in the end, turned out to be quite an easy option, but alas, on install the app forces you to offer marketing information, which is another downside. In fairness, I was pleasantly surprised the checkout was still filled from the website to the app based on my username, so that was what made this a 3 star rather than a 2.",03 February 2024,IE

Ryan,IDisability wasn’t taken seriously I recently complained about 2 pairs off running pants I purchased from the Nike shop in Manchester England and was told with a receipt nothing could be done. My career then approached citizens advice and they told him running is the only thing since leaving hospital in 2019 with a severe breakdown. I have sent u both code off the inside off the tracksuit bottoms with all the appropriate number and digits to prove that they are genuine Nike products. I feel a little disappointed with Nike because I tried not mention my mental heath disabilities and how much of an impact it has on my recovery and day to day life. It was care co-ordinator who told me to persue it because disabled people have rights aswell. But as I struggle over the phone when I first approached Nike I wasn't given enough time to explain my situation.Please look into this againThanks Ryan’s,01 February 2024,GB

Was advised I would hear back but just received an email addressing the order and not the offensive language in the chat. Kept sending emails but NO addressing of my issue.

In short; if you order from Nike.com, you are at risk of not receiving your parcel because their chosen courier will leave the parcel in an exposed location at high risk of theft, as opposed to delivering to a door like they're supposed to. High value items should require a signature on delivery.",08 January 2024,IE

Ks,"If I could I , I would give a 0 star. I sent back 2 items , the post office man ran out of paper so he said it should be fine, he written the return refence number date and address on a piece of paper. Me stupid , didn’t think this would create such a big problem, but Nike only refunded me for 1 item, when I asked them – DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICES, they said I need to go back to post office get the receipt ? from my very first contact I told them I do not have the receipt and ITS NOT MY FAULT, asked them to put me to a supervisor or manager – they said cant do that. So now I’m short of £50 because courier maybe stole the item , or Nike just doesn’t want me to refund me for the item I don’t even have and have returned in good faith. Will dispute with bank as well as this isn’t acceptable. Below are my order details, I’m not afraid to put them up as I genuinely returned both items in good faith.

MK,"Nike customer service in Germany is horrible. They act like they don’t speak English and are quick to get you off the phone. As a loyal Nike/Jordan fan I am really disappointed and it deserves no stars. Also, using delivery such as UPS makes things even worse as they don’t leave no notes/pick up number to let you know where your order has been dropped off. Absolutely terrible experience ordering from Nike.",02 January 2024,DE
Simran Kang,Customer service online is shocking. They have no email option only live chat or call! People don't have time to do these things. Multiple issues bought up over chat and they just end the chat without actually sorting the issue. USELESS. Get told different things from different people. For a BIG company selling overpriced stuff you'd think they can afford good customer service,08 January 2024,GB
Martin Allen,"Another example of why it is important to read reviews, even for big companies like this. Ordered a pair of trainers as a gift with delivery shown a day before I needed them. Got dispatched but three days later I am still waiting and have missed the deadline. Apparently “dispatched” means they are waiting to be picked up by the carrier so a day after the advertised delivery date the trainers are still sitting in the warehouse. Don’t waste your time trying to contact them either, needless to say I won’t be ordering again, their customer service is terrible and they survive on reputation. Complete joke",08 January 2024,GB
Allie,The service is in the gutter. What more can I say besides refer to the reputation of being under 2 stars. They won't even allow me to buy shoes. I'm not sure how they even survive losing loyal customers. Also their shoes are painfully narrow.,03 January 2024,US

Bob,"The returns process is abysmal. Almost like its been designed to be clunky so that you miss the return date.First, if you have multiple items from a single order, these have to be returned separately. There's no way to bundle them into a single return. Even though Nike ask ""please use the original packaging iof possible"". But you can't because if you return 2 of 3 items you bought, then each item has to be returned as a separate item, a separate return reference and a separate parcel.When they say 'Collect+"" what they really mean is ""Yodel"".. You search for your ""Collect+ drop off location"", and when you get there, they refuse the parcel because there is a tiny marker on the bottom saying ""Yodel""..Why they don't just have a link to 'Search for your Yodel drop off"" I don't know.. As I said, likely so that you waste your time returning parcels to a Collect+ drop off point that doesn't accept Yodel.It's 2024, Internet shopping has been around for decades, yet Nike seem to have systems that were designed in 1997.. For a multi (hundreds of)-billion $ company it's very poor",05 January 2024,GB
Bob W,"I've had to deal with their Customer Service more than once lately, and was very impressed - answer almost immediately and so helpful.

Sinead Larkin,Whilst using the Nike app this year I found it to be quite bad what ever was going on this year. I placed 3 orders in total only to have them all cancelled day before expected delivery. I understand the time of year and that stock levels change all the time and some items maybe become unavailable but for such a big brand name I find it very unprofessional for this to be made aware to the customer day before expected delivery. It caused me such stress at an already stressful time of year. Nike need to do better with there app. I can't say I'll never buy the brand again as I have two teenagers at home and it's such a sough after brand. But would be sceptical to use the app again.,04 January 2024,IE

Mrs. Alex Godman,Ordered customised trainers for my daughter’s birthday. Ordered in plenty of time to allow for the up to 3 weeks delivery. Checked the order status last night only to find the update of “returned” I had no despatch notification or any updates to say there was an issue.Opened at chat with Nike to be told that the courier had damaged them in transit  and it was the couriers issues not Nikes. I now have no gift for my daughters birthday and Nike simply don’t care!  They claimed they only knew of the issue because I had instigated the chat! Not very helpful at all.,02 January 2024,GB
Tony Deluca,Worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. These people act like I’m supposed to be happy when I’ve been waiting for an order for over 3 weeks then want to laugh at my concerns.

Get it together Nike you are supposed to be the gold standard  yet you are far from it!,01 January 2024,US
Jordan,"I placed an order via the Nike UK online store on 26th November 2023. The expected arrival date was 30th Nov. On the 30th, I received an e-mail to say that my order was delayed, with no expected delivery date. After 2 weeks, having still not received my order, I got in touch with Nike via online chat and requested my order be cancelled. I was advised the process would take 5-10 days and I would receive a cancellation e-mail in due course. It is now 2nd Jan 2024 - over 5 weeks since my original order. I am still yet to receive a cancellation e-mail or refund for my order.I am quite simply stunned that one of the most internationally recognised and market leading sportswear brands is capable of delivering such a poor customer experience. I understand it’s the busy Christmas period — but to not deliver a product, and then to have to wait 5-10 days until a ‘senior’ member of the team reviews the cancellation request, is beyond me. The process is quite clearly broken and the sheer volume of negative reviews on here should be a major red flag to Nike management. Unfortunately I will not be ordering from Nike online again and advise others to shop elsewhere.",02 January 2024,GB
David Godsell,Ordered within the time for Xmas. Website said despatched.  Courier tracking said not even collected at that point.  Finally delivered on the 30th.  Would love to send them back but looking at other people's reviews I doubt I'll ever see my money back.  Which is probably their goal.  When I phoned they just read from the script.  Offering 20% off my next order which won't be happening yet promising me would be here before Xmas.  Luars and horrendous customer service,20 December 2023,GB

adam levy,".I visited the Nike store at Rugby with my partner recently. After browsing, trying on shoes, and deciding against a purchase, we left. To our shock, we were accused of theft by the store's security, insisting on searching our bag containing items purchased elsewhere - sweetcorn and hair gel. Their reason? We didn't initially enter with a bag.The embarrassment and public scrutiny were appalling. We were wrongfully targeted based on racial stereotypes. The only excuse they could give us was that we had a boots bag that we didnt have when we walked in ... must of pulled the shopping out my backside in the store. Not to mention that 90% of other people had shopping bags with them. We have never been involved in criminal activities and felt humiliated by their baseless accusations.This experience was not just upsetting but deeply disappointing in this day and age. I believe the staff urgently needs cultural sensitivity training to eliminate racial biases. My partner and I are law-abiding citizens, and the unjust treatment we received has tarnished our view of the brand",23 December 2023,GB

I order a pair of shoes at 17 december and at 22 december they cancelled the order without my permission. I phone call the customer service to ask why my order got cancelled and they get it back? And they replied that i wasnt at home to pick up the item, meanwhile UPS told me they never received the item from them.I asked them to refund my money back since they decided to borrow my money and they never send the shoes in first place and they told me i have to wait 10 work days to receive my money back. So we talk 20 days in total NIKE borrow my money and who knows in how many people did that aswell. Well done NIKE!!! Worst than banks!!! I didnt want the money i paid back NIKE, all i wanted was the shoes i paid for and you cancelled my order alone without any reason to give me. TLDR: 200 euros shoes never received, NIKE cancelled the order without any reason after 5 days from the order and now i wait for them to refund me in the next 10 work days!

The only way they said the managers would review the case again is if I filed a legal complaint. What the hell ?",22 December 2023,GB
J.,"Placed a 3-item order on 12/13 with a 12/20 delivery date, and it hadn't shipped as of 12/21 despite the website saying otherwise;  the website also has 12/20 published as the last date to receive items by 12/24. I initially contacted customer service through the chat and was told to contact the carrier. When I explained that the item hadn't been shipped, I was then told the issue would be escalated, and I could expect a response in 5 to 7 business days. Considering that the order was placed for a Christmas gift, a 5 to 7 business day wait time just to find out what's being done about the order seemed extreme.After ending the chat, I called customer service for a status update and was told that my options were to get a refund or have the item reshipped after the holiday. I was also told then, after the order had been marked as shipped, that an item that I'd purchased was out of stock. I ended up finding a store that had the items in stock to reorder what had been canceled on the unfulfilled order, but it's been a major inconvenience, especially now having to drive +30-miles to pick up the order. It would have been nice if customer service at least offered to locate a store where the items were in stock. Considering how close it is to the holiday, I can understand things being busy and shipping resources limited. My issue is the lack of communication, lack of care/concern, and limited effort to make things right.",21 December 2023,US

Nick,"I ordered a pair of Nike trainers yesterday. Delivery was set for my home address on Thursday. I received a confirmation email today that the order was being shipped to a pick up point for Wednesday.I eventually found (as Nike don't appear to want to make it easy for you to contact them) and chatted to Nike online. Nike don't give their staff names they are just a ""Nike Athlete"". I explained that a delivery address location had been changed to an unspecified pick up location.Nike Athlete: [sic]Thank you. So, the carrier may have changed this themselves as they may not be able to deliver this to your address. Unfortunately we cannot change this back, but this wont be much longer for you at all.I explained this was disgraceful. I referred to a previous experience with Nike who had delivered my parcel to this address the last time I used this service and I had to go and collect it, got caught in a torrential downpour, nearly got pneumonia.I asked how could they change the delivery address, and to cancel my order and refund me.Nike Athlete: This was the courier Nick, not Nike. The carrier have advised they have changed this to the shop? The carrier must have an issue delivering this to your address and so this is why they changed it. I cannot cancel the order at this stage, but it can be refused at the shop and they will be refunded immediately.I advised that dpd deliver to my area, I wouldn't be going to the shop and so count it as refused. I said how can Nike treat its' customers this way. They should penalise the courier not the customers and I demanded a refund.Nike Athlete: We cant do that until the shop sends this back and it has reached our warehouse. It would be impossible until then. I am unsure why you are saying this, as the courier are the ones who have decided to re-route this parcel, not Nike. Nike did not change this. As advised I can understand the frustration but we will need to wait for the parcel to be sent back and reach our warehouse.I then asked, where they for real as they were unsure why I was saying what I was saying.Nike Athlete: Yes I am real.I then said I wished to raise a complaint. Nike Athlete: I can take your complaint here. Nike.com take complaints as feedback and all complaints are dealt with internally. You will not hear back from this.At this point I realised that Nike are not interested in my complaint. They are not interested in their customers. It's apparent that they are only interested in profit.My purchase was with Nike not dpd, and the fact that Nike allows you to register a complaint that goes unanswered speaks volumes.

Caroline Harte,"Purchased runners online in September. After waiting patiently 3 1/2 weeks for delivery I contacted customer service, who told me I would be issued with a refund as runners were not dispatched. I received no refund and in November I received the runners. I returned them to Nike in Kildare Village, Ireland, and was informed money would be in my account in a few days. 5 weeks later I still have not received my refund. Customer service said it was not their problem, that I have to contact the store(the phone number does not work), and that I have to go to the store(which is 2 hours away) Disgraceful way to treat customers. Will never buy Nike again.",18 December 2023,IE
Nick,"I ordered a pair of Nike trainers yesterday. Delivery was set for my home address on Thursday. I received a confirmation email today that the order was being shipped to a pick up point for Wednesday.I eventually found (as Nike don't appear to want to make it easy for you to contact them) and chatted to Nike online. Nike don't give their staff names they are just a ""Nike Athlete"". I explained that a delivery address location had been changed to an unspecified pick up location.Nike Athlete: [sic]Thank you. So, the carrier may have changed this themselves as they may not be able to deliver this to your address. Unfortunately we cannot change this back, but this wont be much longer for you at all.I explained this was disgraceful. I referred to a previous experience with Nike who had delivered my parcel to this address the last time I used this service and I had to go and collect it, got caught in a torrential downpour, nearly got pneumonia.I asked how could they change the delivery address, and to cancel my order and refund me.Nike Athlete: This was the courier Nick, not Nike. The carrier have advised they have changed this to the shop? The carrier must have an issue delivering this to your address and so this is why they changed it. I cannot cancel the order at this stage, but it can be refused at the shop and they will be refunded immediately.I advised that dpd deliver to my area, I wouldn't be going to the shop and so count it as refused. I said how can Nike treat its' customers this way. They should penalise the courier not the customers and I demanded a refund.Nike Athlete: We cant do that until the shop sends this back and it has reached our warehouse. It would be impossible until then. I am unsure why you are saying this, as the courier are the ones who have decided to re-route this parcel, not Nike. Nike did not change this. As advised I can understand the frustration but we will need to wait for the parcel to be sent back and reach our warehouse.I then asked, where they for real as they were unsure why I was saying what I was saying.Nike Athlete: Yes I am real.I then said I wished to raise a complaint. Nike Athlete: I can take your complaint here. Nike.com take complaints as feedback and all complaints are dealt with internally. You will not hear back from this.At this point I realised that Nike are not interested in my complaint. They are not interested in their customers. It's apparent that they are only interested in profit.My purchase was with Nike not dpd, and the fact that Nike allows you to register a complaint that goes unanswered speaks volumes. It is basically them telling you, ""you are small and unimportant and we don't give a #### BECAUSE YOU ARE SMALL AND UNIMPORTANT!!"".I am horrified that in this day and age companies like Nike are allowed to get away with such treatment.This really IS the last time I buy a Nike product.

RYAN,"I currently have 6 pairs of Nike shoes.All of them smell after they get wet - even months after they still smell like cat urine.4 of the pairs are air max shoes which squeak when I walk.Online live chat is useless - they ended the Chat 4 times without helping.They want order numbers yet the shows were purchased from an official Nike store and I don’t have the receipts.I just want to know why the biggest sportswear manufacturer sells shoes that don’t last more than 3 months and why they smell after the first time they get wet?Unfortunately, in the UK, it rains a lot and you can’t get your shoes dry when it does so Nike shouldn’t be selling shoes in the UK since they use cheap glue to maximise their profits!!!",18 December 2023,GB

Michaela Johnson,"For the best part of 6 months I’ve been unable to make an order using my account. I keep getting an error message 84D281F3. I have called their customer service team regarding this several times and nothing is done about it. The other day I made an order using guest checkout and another email address. The item was returned back to the Nike store by dpd. When I rang Nike they told me dpd couldn’t locate my address. I knew this was ridiculous as I personally know all the dpd drivers in my area. Their van is on my road everyday. I called dpd and they told me Nike are lying, the reason the item was sent back is because the package is damaged. So not only have I been inconvenienced for over 6 months with my account not working - I’ve even had to result to sports direct and other stores to find what I am looking for, but when I finally do make an order there’s a new issue concerning that. Nikes way of saying sorry is a 10% discount code. How do they expect me to use the discount code if I can’t make a successful order lol. Furthermore the representative tried to tell me to order my items for pick up. My nearest Nike store is in London, I live outside of London lol.",14 December 2023,GB

I’m £70 out of pocket and so upset about this. It’s appalling customer service. Only way to contact is by a chargeable telephone number. You then are put through to an ‘athlete’ who shows complete disinterest and tells you they will speak to a ‘senior’ who will decide your fate. You NEVER HEAR BACK. I have photographic evidence of the missing item from DPD. You can clearly see the number of parcels was not sufficient for the tracking number. PayPal also just take their word that items were delivered because they quote the tracking number. Paypal have made me complete an action fraud form with the police to progress the dispute. It is completely ludicrous. I am so shocked at the way I have been treated. I am going to get legal advice and report to trading standards. I’m not going to let this go.

It looked like I’d bought them used off eBay. Nike Customer services don’t care.I can also add, when I tried to speak to a supervisor as the customer services person said they couldn’t help, they said that service isn’t available and they wouldn’t give me their name or any number to distinguish themselves from other staff.

It never happened and it took over 6 months to be resolved and get a refund. I was not refunded until 2022. On their system it stated the shoes had been returned for over 6 months but they still had possession of my money lol…. Nothing was refunded to my card until I remembered and contacted them. I asked to speak to a manager and the person on the phone kept trying to bribe me saying they will give me a discount code instead. I was adamant that I wanted to speak to a manager because I desperately wanted my custom Nike Dunks, not a refund and discount code.. but they were practically begging me and not giving in to my request for a manager. It was the most unprofessional and confusing customer service experience ever. He was obviously working from home and had no training. Eventually I got tired and accepted the offer of a discount code or credit. He said he would send it to my email and never did. I received nothing. I did not want to go through that again so never called again as I literally felt harassed and bribed.

I first placed an order during Black Friday for the discount, and that was 2 weeks ago. After 12 days I still didn't get my order and on the carrier's page (DHL) it shows that the tracking number doesn't even exist. I asked the Nike customer service about the order status and got the reply that my parcel is probably lost in transit and they're willing to give me a new gift card, but they didn't mention the Black Friday discount though, and the new gift card simply doesn't work because I keep getting error message. I was told to try in Incognito tab and their app but none worked. Apparently I'm not alone here. I'll keep asking Nike till I get a satisfactory answer.

I exchanged at Nike store and another pair was delivered on time. Again the same issue. I am frustrated in receiving used products, scuffed and discoloured. I will be exchanging again untill I get perfectly brand new trainers. Shoddy and poor service from Nike.

Mathias Würtz Kolster,"Et par af mine Jordans er gået i stykker inden for garantiperioden, og derfor kontakter jeg Nike for at få en form for kompensation. De giver mig to muligheder. Enten skal jeg sende dem retur, hvorved jeg vil blive kompenseret, og ellers skal jeg tage ind i en Nike-butik med dem. De kan også give en 20% rabatkode – fedt når de kører 25% grundet Black Friday. Derfor kører jeg til Aarhus, hvor jeg får at vide, at de ikke kan behandle ordrer fra Webshoppen, fordi de ikke er en partner-butik men blot en form for Reseller. Det virker ekstremt ulogisk taget deres ALT, der resterer af information omkring denne butik i betragtning. Den eneste information, der bliver givet, er, at det er en (partnered)-butik på Nikes hjemmeside. Det er ikke noget, de gør meget ud af at fortælle om. De kunne i hvert fald ikke gøre noget. Derfor ringede jeg igen til Nike, som kun kunne give mig én mulighed – at indsende skoene. Det stoler jeg simpelthen ikke på. De er alt for værdifulde for mig til, at jeg bare vil sende dem ind og eventuelt få nogle penge tilbage. Jeg synes, at det er ekstremt ringe, at der ikke stilles andre løsninger i udsigt. Vi er godt vante i Danmark, hvor andre forhandlere kompenserer, men åbenbart ikke Nike.A couple of my Jordans have broken within the warranty period, so I contact Nike to get some kind of compensation. They give me two options. Either I can send them back, in which case I will be compensated, or I can take them to a Nike store. They can also give a 20% discount code - great when they're running 25% off due to Black Friday. So I drive to Aarhus, where I'm told that they can't process orders from the webshop because they are a partner store but not an official reseller. This seems extremely illogical considering ALL that remains of information about this store. The only information given is that it is a (partnered) store on Nike's website. It's not something they make a big deal about. They certainly couldn't do anything about it. So I called Nike again and they could only give me one option - to return the shoes. I simply don't trust that. They are far too valuable to me to just send them in and ‘possibly’ get a refund. I think it is extremely poor that no other solutions are offered. We are used to other retailers in Denmark compensating, but apparently not Nike.",06 December 2023,DK

Nike ambassador for thirty yrs,"I usually don't care about product delays, discounts, etc. Nike was always just like any other, but today changes that. Never in my life have I heard of a famous brand deliberately try to con customers in a sly way just to squeeze some extra profit. Long story short, they manufactured a product range called Nike Club+ Winterized Fleece and screwed up. There are huge holes (missing fleece panels) behind the paper thin reinforced nylon panels. This is like having sections of your clothes replaced with just paper so it feels strange, cold and windy. We know Nike screwed up their manufacturing process because their design was copied from a popular outdoor design from other famous brands like The North Face, so you can easily see what Nike's product range was supposed to be. They never published the product range on their portfolio but they continued to distribute the faulty products anyway to numerous outlets with instructions to insert a huge RRP price tag alongside a huge discount, making customers seem like they are getting a deal. The product descriptions, unsurprisingly, are full of misleading marketing jargon. Those outlets selling the faulty product coincidentally never have free shipping or free return shipping, meaning there's a large chance the customer will not bother returning the product, so the customers will eventually pay for Nike's error. I've heard many stories of Nike's greed culture for decades, and secretly hiring kids to make their shoes while exaggerating and even at times, outright making stuff up, about how green and great and socially responsible they are, which I honestly didn't care too much about, but this new discovery really shows how evil Nike actually is. Rather than ignore this issue after a few huffs and puffs like the average person, I am publicly documenting it. I am ashamed to have supported Nike for so long - God knows how many other customers were silently victimized and how many other products they screwed up in. This review will probably not get many eyes but rest assured I will echo this new discovery in many groups to protect us, the customers. If you are reading this, help us echo too.",05 December 2023,IE

Seriously, it is pot luck if you ever get your stuff.I ordered a pair of shoes and didn't even get a notification that the pick up store had ""rejected delivery"". I had to chase this up myself, when upon doing so the store looked blankly at me and said that no delivery had been received.Without even contacting me, the shoes were returned to the warehouse where they have disappeared. They are now no longer online, so that's that. I'll never get them.Seriously. It is pot luck. Do yourself a favour and just don't risk it. This isn't the first time it has happened. It has happened to me constantly and I've used different deliver pick up stores. The online chat is maddening. They don't seem to grasp the problem and offer to give me the same 25% off the item. What they couldn't grasp is that including the discount code I actually had 50% off, so if I re-purchased them lie they suggested (which I can't, because they are out of stock as I kept saying to them!)

Bethany Martin,"Ordered shoes in the Black Friday sale and DPD failed to deliver them as my address was ""undeliverable"" despite the fact that all other couriers seem to find it. They sent them back to Nike instead. Nike live chat was useless. I asked them to send a replacement or to resend my parcel. They said they couldn't as they didn't know their stock levels until an update, and that I would have to buy the shoes again that are now twice the price. When I told them this sounded like fraud, they told me they would discount the shoes but were unable to tell me how this would work just ""Buy them again and we'll discount them"". I refused as this did not sound trustworthy at all. When I asked to complain, they told me that I wasn't able to make a complaint. I couldn't complain to them as that wasn't their department.",29 November 2023,GB

DPD went to retrieve my package from wrong address and returned it to their depot and still haven’t delivered my parcel. The parcel tracking status shows it’s back at the depot and Nike are refusing to refund me and said it wait until investigation has been resolved even though DPD tracking shows it’s at the depot!

Kellie,"Order C01307915317- spent almost £70 on a pair of trainers for my sons Xmas present- arrived damaged. Contacted their customer service team who requested photos- complied without delay- it’s been OVER A WEEK since I was told that a manager would call me to discuss- NOTHING. I have contacted them EVERY DAY- only to be told this call back is pending. Absolutely terrible service- fed up is an understatement!!!**UPDATE** 22 Dec 2023- still have not managed to speak to a manager. The level (lack of) training is beyond poor. Customer agents are given a script and have no authorisation to use initiative and logic to provide any sort of resolution to the customer. Today, I spoke TOAA who was as useless as a car with no engine. Simply there to pick up a call- that’s where it ends.

Aga,"Black Friday deal advertised but unable to place order online or by app. Error appear every time at the end of payment process. Checked different  accounts, different browsers, different phones and laptops, cleared cookies. On error message there is a phone number provided to call customer sevice. At first call they advise due to number of people website doesn't manage with orders and blocked accounts for at least 24h, yhey advise to try after 24 hours. Asked if can place order over phone- no. 24 hours later of course the same happened -called cust serv again. They raised investigation which can take 3-8 working days. So response will be after promotion is over. In the meantime kept trying but the same problem occuring. Advised that the only way to buy goods is to go physically to the shop. In my case it's at least 3 hours drive one way. Not the service expected from such a well known company.

I called Nike I explained to them what Dpd had said and Nike said it'll take ten working days to get intouch with Dpd so the investigation can begin. I mean 10 WORKING DAY!!. By then the birthday would be past. I really don't understand how it will take two weeks to get intouch with the delivery company they always use to deliver thier customers orders.

They had given me the wrong tracing number, once I called they ended up cancelling my ordered and started my refund. I called back because the woman had said I could reorder it again but the app wouldn’t let me. So I wanted to see if anything could be done, I sat through the over the phone questions twice and both times got hung up on.

Oliver McQuillin,"Should be 0 stars, absolutely diabolical Nike customer service. When trying to purchase on Nike.Com - I receive notification that ""payment is not accepted"" - my employee discount is applied, however when purchasing it doesn't allow me to fulfil the order. (former employee btw) This issue has been ongoing since the 1st March 2023.I have spoken with all departments including HR, IT, Customer Service and my own line manager and no department and no individual has been able to rectify this issue. I asked on far too many occasions to reset my log on details and have been provided with the explanation that my purchasing history will be removed. This is ridiculous response to a customer and former internal colleague. The whole operation is utterly pathetic. As a long-time supporter of Nike and a frequent customer, this experience has left me feeling disheartened and undervalued as a customer. I believe that a brand like Nike, known for its quality products, should also excel in providing exceptional customer service.I sincerely hope that improvements can be made within your customer service department to ensure that customers like me receive the support and assistance they deserve when facing issues with Nike products. Your attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.",25 November 2023,GB

Unfortunately, within just one month of use, the shoes developed significant wear and tear issues, including a noticeable tear. I promptly reached out to both Nike and Myntra to address the problem. However, the response from both ends was disappointing. Despite my efforts, there was no resolution, neither in terms of a replacement nor a refund.The lack of durability in a product at this price point is concerning, and the unhelpful customer service only added to the frustration. As a loyal customer, I expected better from Nike and Myntra.I would caution others to think twice before investing in Nike products through Myntra, considering the subpar quality and the unsatisfactory customer support. It’s disheartening when a trusted brand fails to uphold its standards.",24 November 2023,IN

Took a video and uploaded to live chat and email, they agreed it was faulty but still wanted me to return it, informed them I did not have time to go to a post office to return it and I didn't have the packaging so they arranged a collection.  Gave them exact collection instructions which they did not pass on to the carrier and the carrier failed to collect as the area they went to knew nothing of the collection.  Now they have gone back on the agreement and won't arrange another collection even though the failure was due to them.

Yesterday we attempted to place an order, using the start 23 promo code and a gift voucher adding both gift card  number and pin. All the details were placed correctly including shipping and billing etc. On placing the order, an error code came up so the order wouldn’t process. I rang the company this morning to report this  only to be told that I would get a phone call straight back. Needless to say I did not receive that call. I have just spent an hour and 15 minutes on chat with them, trying to resolve it for them. We have been given every single excuse under the Sun as to why the order won’t go through. We have furnished them with every single piece of information they have requested including the screenshots of the order. We have checked the billing. We have checked the shipment details along with everything else three times over, We have also emailed them the details and tried emptying the basket and re-ordering on different devices as they have requested none of this works as I informed them. It is quite obvious to me that along with our account details they have this order on screen but are still requesting proof which we have provided twice and they are still maintaining that they cannot resolve this which is quite obviously complete rubbish. At this point I asked for this to be further escalated and requested to be put through to a complaints department. At this point, the chat was ended without my consent! What an absolute joke of a company!! Please be aware folks that if you are purchasing gift cards with this company, you will be unable to redeem them and they will certainly not assist you in this matter. This was a simple issue that should have been resolved in 5 mins and yet they are refusing to assist any further. This is quite easily the worst experience I have ever had with any retailer. They quite obviously do not honour gift cards so be wise and shop elsewhere. I am a long-standing customer of Nike but never again will I spend a penny with this awful company. I will be reporting this to Trading Standards  immediately!",20 November 2023,GB

R M,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent order I made from Nike. I received a pair of shoes, but unfortunately, they were the wrong ones inside the correct box. To rectify this error, I traveled from Epsom to Westfield (Shepherd's Bush) hoping to exchange them for the right pair. Upon reaching the store, they informed me that although they had the correct shoes, they couldn't facilitate the exchange.Subsequently, I contacted Nike's customer service to inquire about the possibility of exchanging the shoes in-store. However, I was advised to return the incorrect shoes via the post office to receive a refund and then purchase the correct pair separately. This was incredibly frustrating, as the mistake wasn't mine, yet I was being inconvenienced by having to go to the post office.Following another call to Nike, a different representative assured me that if the store could exchange the shoes, I could do it there. Returning to the Nike store, I explained the situation once more. However, despite confirming that the wrong shoes were cheaper than the ones I ordered and acknowledging the mix-up, they declined the exchange as the prices did not match.I am extremely upset about this entire ordeal. It's frustrating to endure unnecessary inconvenience due to someone's lack of attention to detail, resulting in the wrong items being sent. I regret to say that this experience has seriously undermined my trust in Nike's online ordering system. I hope that Nike can improve their processes to better assist customers facing such issues in the future.",14 November 2023,GB

My younger kids were so excited and fell in love with the tiny box. We asked if they have another one for my other little one. We were told that we have to purchase a gift card minimum of $5 to get the box. We paid for the apparels but didn't buy any gift card. We were about the leave the store. The cashier yelled out to my 6 year old child who was holding the tiny shoe box in her hands that she cannot take the box. We left the store but now I'm so irritated the fact I spent almost $200 and they can't even spare a tiny box made out of cardboard to my child. I don't think a tiny box will break Nike's bank. My child was so sad. I apologized to my kids that I'll being returning all the items we have just purchased. I went back inside the store. The employees and manager were all rude and have attitudes. Non of which has any customer service skills. I returned every item I have just purchased not even 10 minutes ago.

Jola Zenel,If I could I wouldn’t even give one star. Been Nike customer for years and I loved their  brand but lately there has  been so many issues.Most of them had been sorted except  one. Someone from their staff stole my gift card code and used it online. Basically I bought a trainers and had warranty 2 years. They got manufactory fault and I send the trainers for inspection. They accepted and issued the refund. The lady send me gift card and PIN number to my email. After a week I decided to use it and the card was empty. I contacted them straight away and been told that the card has been used they even told me the name and when was used. I never gave the gift card to anyone I didn’t even know how to check the balance. They told me I might gave  to someone when but I did not. They not suppose to allow other ppl to use it when they issue for a specific customer. I reported to action fraud and when I texted them that I reported they never replied back. Then another one just about a month ago I purchase trainers and they send me completely different model shoes and they was 60£ cheaper then the original price I paid for the shoes I wanted. Also lost 10£ on top cash back app as they had to refund it and needed to purchase again. Also another time they send me a track suit which was worn and had very strong smell  and was also a replica from China. In the recent times Nike has gone down. They don’t treat the customers well and I don’t know why but I always have problems with them. I am not a person to complain but enough is enough.,23 August 2023,GB

Tenille,"I paid for expedited next day service and when talked to customer service to make sure everything was on track I was told it was. The reason I reached out to customer service was because I had not received any shipping information. So fast forward to the day my delivery should be happening I get an email telling me there is a delay, but not giving me any timeline on when to expect my shipment. So I reached out to customer service again and they said they do not have any information about the shipment either. To me that's ridiculous. I was told to wait until the end of day and if my package does not arrive then to reach back out to them. I said if the package had been shipped wouldn't they know it? I pointed out that they are not just sending packages out without knowing where they are going. Then the customer service agent said again to wait until the end of day and reach back out.",09 November 2023,US

Megan,"Obviously upon checking the reviews are BADWhat a shoddy company. Ordered some items, wasn't in for delivery and so they were taken to a local drop off store. I collected three days later and noticed 3 items missing so contacted Nike immediately who AT FIRST acted apologetic, said they'd request a refund and ask the courier. Courier OBVIOUSLY denies damage to parcel ( like they have a clear recollection of every parcel they deliver and LIKE they can verify no tampering while it was at drop off point for 3 days) - anyway i was told I'd hear back in 3 to 5 working days.. 16 days later.. nothing. So I contact them myself to THEN be told the courier said there was no damage (like a theif is going to admit being a theif) and was promptly told 'bye' by the Nike agent !!!! Zero other explanation. ZERO interest in next steps.. what I could do next. Literally RUDE, ABNOXIOUS staff once they deem the case closed. ZERO interest in if your items have been stolen. Don't bother with Nike anymore. The reviews speak for themselves. Will be opening up a small claim court case for them to deal with.",08 November 2023,GB

Alastair,For the past three weeks I have been trying to get a pair of trainers delivered for my nephews birthday.the first order never turned up and they claimed the courier vou still find my address which has never happened before with and delivery.Also they know the courier guy who delivers locally for Nike and he told me had never had a thing for me in the past 3 weeks.After an exhausting chat with what I suspect was a robot with random emojis that didn’t make any sense and lots of pre loaded insincere apologies and rubbish about how important I am to them the chat was interrupted and somebody else took over who may have been real .who knows?! .they sorted it apparently so a new order was created and meant to be despatched with urgency.Nine days later and it is still waiting to be shipped.I have had three conversations with their AI  chatbot very similar to the above all eventually interrupted by somebody else and never with any resolution or explanation we are no further forward.They don’t seem to care at all and I have never once been contacted by email or phone as requested to resolve the issue.Bonkers that a billon dollar card company can not even spend some money to actually have customer service ls you can talk to and resolve issues l.Then maybe their customer might believe that they are part of the ‘Nike Family ‘ that they so relentlessly bang on about in their app and every bit of marketing they produce.Never again will a buy from this arrogant company who are incapable of even delivering the products they advertise.,02 November 2023,GB

Order missing, money taking no stock & not informed for weeks and weeks. Returns always an issue, latest return only refunded 1 item and not 2, uploaded proof with parcel weight which they requested and two weeks later they have refused. Basically who ever completed the return has stole my item and pretended it wasn’t in the parcel. Honestly this is the absolute worst company to use.. use at your own will, be prepared for monkeys who haven’t a clue about anything to do with Nike to be dealing with your requests!

claratan,"When i ordered a pair of shoes , it came in the wrong size and couldnt fit so i called their customer support to see if im eligible for a return which i should be since i only tried the shoe and it does not fit on me. The employee first told me that i had to call another number and register for a return. It was a headache and a hassle to do since they could easily have a place on their website to register for a return which would be more convenient for customers in general. Although the return process was a hassle, the shoe was able to be returned in 2 days so i am satisfied with it. I only hope for the initial return process to be quicker and more convenient as it made me feel as my shoes were in limbo for a certain amount of time.",11 November 2022,SG

The first time I ordered, I got an email a few days later, telling me that sadly the items I ordered and they already had taken money for, were actually sold out. Okay, happens, though quite ridiculous for such a prominent and wealthy firm. Tried with something else a few weeks later, to give them a second chance. Same thing happened. That was 2 years ago. Tried again Friday, because they were the only ones who had the style of sports bra I wanted. Just now got an email, that actually the items were sold out and thus my order cancelled. Best bit? The email immediately highlights that it could take considerable time for me to get my money back, because their system basically doesn’t know that I can’t buy the items that are listed there. Words fail me. I had to wait a fair amount of time 2 years ago to get my money back, but had relied on them having improved their process by now. They haven’t.

Kamil oraczko,"Unresolved Refund Issue - Extremely Disappointed CustomerI am deeply disappointed with my recent experience with Nike's customer service and returns process. I returned a pair of shoes in early September, and despite receiving confirmation that a refund was processed on the 10th of September, the funds have yet to be credited back to my account.This situation is completely unacceptable. Nike has their goods, but I am left without my money. I have waited patiently, but my refund has not materialized. What adds to the frustration is the contradictory information I have received from Nike's customer service agents. The lack of clarity and consistency in their responses has only added to my frustration and confusion.I strongly urge anyone considering a purchase from Nike to think twice. Their customer service is appalling, and their returns process is incredibly flawed. It's disheartening to see a company of Nike's reputation mishandle a simple refund transaction. As a customer, I expect reliability and transparency, both of which were sorely lacking in this experience.This incident has shattered my trust in Nike as a brand. I hope this review serves as a warning to potential buyers. Nike took my money and the shoes back, but they failed to deliver on their end of the transaction. I will think long and hard before considering another purchase from Nike in the future.",27 October 2023,GB

This is the second time it happened in weeks, meaning the second time a jacket ordered from nike gets nicked until it reaches me. However, first time around I got a wall socket instead of the parka. (!) And Nike decided to reimburse. This time around, no parka, no money either. This is with the police and the ombudsman now. Don't buy online from Nike! It might be the dpd. mail pick up places (I used 2 different ones) where thefts occurs, or Nike’s network.

Alex Der,"I am absolutely seething with rage over the abhorrent treatment I've received from Nike at their Oxford Street, London store. Just a couple of months ago, I made the unfortunate decision to buy a pair of shoes from them, and lo and behold, they turned out to be riddled with manufacturing faults. Nike's own policy, which they claim to uphold, states that they offer a two-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. But let me tell you, the reality has been nothing short of a nightmare. Despite bombarding them with countless emails detailing my grievances, they have chosen to not just disregard me but utterly disrespect their own policy. It's a scam, plain and simple! Nike London has zero regard for their own commitments and responsibilities.I am beyond furious, and I vehemently warn anyone even contemplating a purchase from Nike in London to think long and hard.

I spent a whopping 4 HOURS on calls over an 8-week period trying to sort this mess, only to have them randomly send a gift card to my home after they explicitly told me they couldn't. And the icing on the cake? When I finally spoke to an agent about compensation for all the trouble they've put me through, I was told there was nothing they could do.

I explained to him that I don't have printer that if I was to be sent a code to exchange,  could it please go to the person who will have to take them back, they took the email address and still they sent it to me.

The first person serving us at the return desk, in response to my request for an exchange, told me I am being ridiculous and walked away from the desk telling his colleague he is about to lose it. The colleague present grabbed the store manager, another rude member of staff, called Jason who refused to share with us his staff name who had been rude to us and told us to contact customer service for a return, as in his opinion, the issue was 'wear & tear' and refused to acknowledge the issue with the air pump of the airmax trainers (which belong to my 10 years old boy). We were not planning to let such people to ruin our Sunday so we walked away and will try to contact customer services tomorrow. Hopefully they are politer than Jason and his team at the store and we can get our purchase resolved.",15 October 2023,GB

Have also contacted telephone customer service, where communication is impossible due to background noise and exceptionally poor English.Have been told purchase amounts would be returned when Nike got the shoes back (which according to UPS has happened June 2, 2023).

Eden James,"If I could have put 0 stars then I have been pushed fromPillar to post with Nike assist for the last 8 months after being injured on my lower right leg due to faulty Nike go Flyease trainers. Due to the fault the caused me to fall down the stairs.I contacted Nike and they then sent an email with a barrage of questions and asking for digital photos of the trainers.Once I had taken photos of where the accident happened, and filledOut the rest of the questions location indoors or outdoors, weather conditions etc etc sent it away with the order number. And wasPromised by Jeffrey he would get every thing done. Waited a few weeks and nothing. Chased them again and nothing. Spoke to Ritik in May and she asked me to send the trainers back to the Netherlands. And she also said I would be getting compensation as well as a refund for the trainers. The. It all went quiet again. It wasn’t until after chatting to Nike assist on chat numerous times, soMany I lost count. Emmanuel looked into it. He said they hadn’t got the trainers back to which I confirmed back to him they were sent at the beginning of June and I got the refund on the 13th June. 7 days later I got an email with a gift card for £114. Within the letter Nike assist trained to makeOut the refund of £114 was part of a good will gesture. Totally incorrect. Nike members can return faulty trainers for up to 2 years. This infuriated me.From September onwards it was going around and around with Nike assist. I was then offered £300 fromA so called senior manager from either china or the Philippines. He promised it would be with me within the next 24 hours. It never turned up. I was the informed Nike Nike assist it would be with me no later than the following Tuesday. It didn’t turn up. By this time and 7 months in I was starting toLoose my patience. A senior manager who confined they called from the Philippines with this case apologised and said they would increase the gift card and confirmed it in an email through Nike assist which I received on the 27th September 2023.We can now advise you that we would like to offer an additional goodwill gesture of £185.05. The GC total was £300 also a 25% promo code Now as you can clearly see this states £185.05 on top of the original £300 gift card.Nike assist in either china or the Philippines are now back tracking and trying to make out the £185.05 is not additional it is in the £300 gift card. Since then I have three so called senior managers all call me back in the last week which has failed miserably. Due to the fact that the line is absolutely terrible as well as I could hardly understand what they was saying due to the poor line. To add insult to injury you could hear another person telling the so called manager on the phone what to say. The most insulting part is when each and every one of them has asked me to hold for twoMinutes and then hang up on me.How in gods nameIs this customer service. Then when I have asked for an email for the UK head office toLodge a formal complaint about the senior team dealing with this case I am toldI cannot have an email because that’s not how Nike works Exactly happens the same when you try and call and ask for the I for the information. How is it good practice for a customer / stakeholder of Nike who wants to lodge a formal complaint is refused the email or telephone number to lodge the complaint. They are told that feedback will be given to the senior team who the customer wants to complain about. How the hell is that logical. I hope Sarah Hannah and John Donohue are so very happy with the way Nike is being so dramatically let down by the Nike assist teams in the Philippines and china. Formover 25 years I have worked in client/customer service and NEVER in my life have I been treated so horribly and ignored by a company. This is Nike for gods sake. What the hell is going on.I am still recovering from the hematoma in my lower right leg. Nikes senior management just simply don’t want to know or care.I have simply lost count of the amount of people who have lied and broken promises again and again and again.Nike assist you should be absolutely ashamed of your disgraceful service.

Janet,"Edit (10/15): Nike did eventually email me their solution as promised but it didn't take 15 minutes as they stated. It took 3 days. By then, I have already purchased elsewhere. The email also claimed that my rejected payment was a bug resolved by their I.T. (tech) team.I bought a pair of regular AF1s and the order the expected delivery date was in 5 days. On day 2, the order was cancelled for no reason. When I reached out to support, they were asking me questions that they should've had the answers to already. This is beyond frustrating that so many companies have payment reviews that can't ""verify"" payment info even when the card is US-issued, billing and shipping address matches and all info is correct. So the agent told me to wait 15 mins for her higher superior to provide a resolution. It's been 4 hours and no resolution email was sent. So I went elsewhere to shop.We're already giving these companies our hard-earned money then we have to waste time talking to their nice/friendly but mediocre support team to figure out why they can't take your money.

However, I returned to the store in Castleford to buy a gift for my wife and saw the same trainers I’d bought 3 days earlier but 20% cheaper. I asked the manager politely that I feel disheartened that I paid more at the same store. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the trainers with me as they were at my home 25 miles away in Bradford. I explained I can get my wife to call me and show the receipt and trainers via video call. I also showed my  phone to the manager as I paid with Apple Pay. The manager refused to refund the difference making every excuse possible. He suggest I come back with the receipt and trainers, by which point I’d be paying more in fuel. Very unhappy.

When they were received back at the warehouse I was only refunded for one pair! I contacted Nike & spoke to many agents & sent a picture of my proof of postage but they say theOnly reason could be  I only sent one pair because the weight shown on the proof of postage wasn’t heavy enough for 2 pairs of trainers. The box was never even weighed at the post office just scanned & taken off me & the weight shown isn’t even heavy  enough for half pair of trainers let alone 2 plus the large box I sent them in so can’t be used as an excuse/reason for what is obviously a mistake in the warehouse. Absolute  joke of a company & terrible customer service for such a big company! To be accused by a so called manager I got to speak to of only sending 1 pair back when I’ve done everything correctly is shocking & rude! Why would I only send 1 pair when I originally got the wrong pair & then spend so much time and effort trying to the this sorted if I had as they never get back to you when they say the will. it’s just an excuse to cover up a mistakes by them  in the warehouse & take money off poor customers!",28 September 2023,GB

The second was not sent to the click and collect location but to my home address, I was unaware of their error so I missed the second delivery which is now in transit back to Nike.The customer service was completely rude and uncaring, basically you will get a refund in due course, goodbye and off you go.

Nike was wasn’t happy with this and wanted a hard copy (picture) or a pdf version but they don’t attach it as a PDF it’s on the body of the email so Nike won’t accept.Even took screen shots on my phone (one do the mailbox showing the email painted and a screen shot of the email body containing the full receipt)Managed to get a PDF copy of the receipt only then to be asked for a bank statement (this was not on original request) Two times in my life I have contacted Nike with faulty products, the first time I give up half way through because odd how difficult it is, Thai time a little more persistent but what a terrible process they have and I think they need to bring the policy in line with the money seen tech world we are on today!!There again you can see by all these reviews how customer focused they are, i only scrolled through a few reviews in here but I can see there has been no response from Nike. Build a brand, gain customer confidence and then treat them like …… customer service needs reviewing !!!",13 September 2023,GB
Sinan Hanay,"I ordered a product online, and returned to the Nike Outlet store in Roermond without using it. They waited me like 10 minutes, then they took it, gave me a receipt. I could not get refund from there after 6 weeks. They gave me a receipt and still have not received my money. After talk with my first Nike they said, they would refund in 9 days. I waited, after my second call, the store claimed that they paid me in cash. Such an unprofessional store and response.Never Nike again.",05 August 2023,NL
Jasmine,"If I could give negative points I would. I would avoid ordering from Nike online, especially in Canada. I ordered a pair of shoes for my son for the new school year. The online ordering kept glitching and booting me out. I ultimately got charged twice for two pairs of shoes. Fine, stuff happens. Noticed the next day and called right away. Was told that I could only cancel within 30 minutes of ordering. I now had to wait for the shoes to be shipped to me and then re-send them back to Nike and once they received them then they could issue a refund. Order was placed and charged on Sept 2. Accidentally called the US number unknowingly and found out I could actually return to any store for a faster refund only to find out several minutes later that I couldn’t do that in Canada when he found out where I was located. This was after FedEx showed that the shoes were coming from Frankfurt in Germany and would take awhile to get here. At this point the issue was escalated and I was told supervisors would review and get back. By September 8th the package was stopped and held at a FedEx facility an hour away from me and got notice on the 11th that it was ready for pick up. I was extremely confused so called FedEx asking why the shoes would be shipped to such a far away facility (I assumed these were the pair I wanted). Call Fedex, they tell me the pkg has been stopped there by Nike and to call them to see what was going on. Call Nike. Nike rep says my one wanted pair is still on way, the pair at FedEx was being returned to Nike and once they have confirmation that Fedex has the unwanted shoes that I will get a refund. I did receive the wanted pair yesterday, which is nice I guess. So today, the 12th, I check the Shop app to see where the unwanted shoes now were and all info disappeared. Call Nike to see what was going on. Rep I spoke with said she would escalate for me.I said it already was escalated and I hadn’t heard back. Then she asked me to screenshot my debit account to prove I was double charged and then email them proof. I said why? I was given two sets of order and tracking numbers and wouldn’t have had the second pair shipped to me in the first place if not paid for in the first place. At this point, after all other requests to speak to a supervisor were denied in the past (except to have situation escalated and being assured I would get an email back from one, which I haven’t to date), I was put on hold and transferred to a supposedly real “supervisor.” Said supervisor then informed me that shoes were on the way back to a Nike facility and once received and processed then a refund could be issued finally. I asked how I was supposed to know where the shoes actually were and when they arrived as anyone could steal them at this point and I wouldn’t know. A tracking number was provided to me after I asked for it basically and wasn’t offered initially at all. Pretty shady to me. Then I asked if it had to ship all the way back to Frankfurt (I had originally asked if they could stop the order in Frankfurt Sept 3rd so that I could get a refund quicker also and was given all sorts of excuses as to why that wasn’t possible btw). At this point he says no, our Nike facility just needs to receive it first. I ask which facility it has to reach. Finally tells me Mississauga Ontario, the other side of the country. Also, once they process and recognize that their facility has actually received the shoes, and whenever they get around to processing the refund, it could take up to 10 additional business days to actually see any money in my account. I will be lucky to see my money back in a month after purchase date, I might add. And all while never laying hands on the unwanted product. I have been given the run around and told a lot of conflicting information and with zero recourse. I am a single parent who lives in one of the most expensive provinces and didn’t budget for an additional $130 at back to school time. It’s absolutely terrible that staff are so misinformed and generally unhelpful and that they treat people like this. Furthermore, there is apparently nothing you can do about it. I will never order from this company again. Their call centres are clearly outsourced to other countries too and no one cares.Just called FedEx after trying to track pkg online and realizing I was given the old tracking number. Recorded info says it was shipped back to sender and delivered to shipping and receiving today, Sept 12 at 5:46pm, and was told pkg was delivered today to facility in Mississauga at 10:46am and signed for by J. Jesse. They may take up to 4 days to report to Nike and however long for Nike to issue refund, then another 10 days for money to get to account. Business days obviously so looking at another 2 weeks at this point, for a total of 1 month for a refund.",01 September 2023,CA
James,"Horrible customer service.  Due to health issues, I have been in the hospital for the better part of the past four years... my aorta dissected, now have a pig valve, pig root, prosthetic aorta over the hemi and then got sarcoidosis from the COVID 19 vaccine, my body does not produce the proper amount of red or white blood cells.   Right before my aorta dissected (was playing tennis at the time...) I had bought five pair of Nike Zoom Cage 3 tennis shoes, fits my foot perfect and knew eventually that you would stop manufacturing this shoe.  During my health struggles, I was fighting for my life, no running or tennis or physical activity restricted to lifting 40 pounds.   Now, after over four years, I have been given the go ahead to start playing tennis again... ""gentile"" tennis.  So, I got out one of my new Cage 3 pairs and broke then in with a walk, then playing tennis.  I noticed that there was something sharp on the outer edge of the left shoe irritating my foot so felt around inside the shoe and found what felt like a nail sticking into my foot.   I attempted to adjust it before playing tennis but no luck.  The object rubbing my foot actually hurt my foot to the extent that after three or four weeks it is still sore.  Knowing that these are new shoes, worn twice, I contacted Nike only to find out that they are ""out of warranty"" due to the fact that the time had been greater than six months.  Under normal circumstances, I do understand this policy but considering I am a loyal Nike customer and I spend the better part of the last four years in the hospital while tying to get better so I could one day maybe play tennis or even jog a quarter of a mile (used to run over 100 miles a week wearing Nike products...)  I was hoping Nike would  consider my situation a special case and perhaps I would qualify for a special exemption.  The two ""customer service"" managers would not even consider any compensation or replacement and were less than professional expressing this stance.  Needless to say, I will be moving on from Nike and find a more compassionate company to do business with in the future.  I will move my business elsewhere.  Buyer BEWARE!!!",12 September 2023,US

Hayley M,Nike do not want to take responsibility of how bad their courier service is. Tracking showed my order was going to be delivered on Sunday so made sure someone was home. I then get a tracking notification on the day to say my order is on the way to a local shop to collect as no one was home (which was untrue) and that I would get another notification once the order arrived at the shop. The next notification was to say my order is on the way back to Nike. I first contacted Nike on the online chat and all the person wanted to do was refund me. I made it clear that I did not want a refund and that I wanted my order to go back out for delivery once they had received it. I then phoned up which wasn't any better and the person said they would investigate. 10 minutes later after coming off the phone was an email processing a refund. A refund that I did not want. What I wanted was my order!,11 September 2023,GB

First time round I got a new discount code , so decided to order again, but then yesterday order cancelled again, and code has been lost. I've just had my chat terminated by the chatbot, for enquiring why they will not honour the discount.  They just told me to reorder at full price and then seek a discount later on, which I have zero faith in ever receiving.  I will not be using the Nike App again, and I will future purchase directly from a store.",11 September 2023,IE

Michael Scotson,"I recently purchased a pair of shoes from Nike , and overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase. The shoes are stylish and comfortable, making them a great addition to my footwear collection. The ordering process was straightforward, and the delivery was prompt.The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had a minor issue with the sizing. I ordered my usual size, but the shoes felt a tad snug at first. However, after wearing them a few times, they seem to be breaking in nicely and becoming more comfortable.Despite the sizing hiccup, I'm happy with my purchase and would consider buying from Nike again in the future. The quality and style of their shoes are definitely a standout.",01 September 2023,IE

Devon,"Nike Gift Cert didn't work. Still not resolved! Nike has my money and I have NO goods.Contacted Nike via Live Chat on Monday when the gift certificate did not work. It was purchased to be used during their sale. Was told via Live Chat that the Gift Certificate was valid. Could I please download the app and try via that? Didn't work. Could I please try clearing the cache and attempt to use again? No luck, still didn't work. I was then told that a new gift certificate would be raised for me to use. I was more then happy with that resolution. However they then told me it will take up to five days!I left it two days and contacted again via Live Chat. I was told this was with the escalation team and they would be in touch with any updates. I just checked today and the sale is now over! I contacted Live Chat again for a valid Gift Certificate to be told again that they will be in touch when they have any updates for me. I asked for it to be escalated and to speak with a manager to be told that there is no other escalation process and no one else to speak to, they will be in touch when they have any updates. I repeatedly asked to speak with a manager, for an immedaitely resolution and valid gift certificate to be provided to be told that I needed to wait. I asked for the name or ID of the individual to whom I was speaking with so I could raise a formal complaint. I was told they do not give any details out as it is a breach of their new data security. So I have no name that I can use to raise an issue with their customer service, no valid gift certificate which they have already been paid, no goods and the goods are now more expensive as the sale is over.

Also, every time I contacted them via the website they said they could not help me and that it is a store issue, but then when I go to the store they tell me it's a company issue.In conclusions, Nike's management skill sucks, it seems like they don't know how to do anything, it's just horrible.",06 September 2023,IT

Han,Ordered trainers for a gift they arrived damaged shouldn’t have passed the quality check. Nike was quick to arrange a return for an exchange. The exchanged pair arrived several days later. This second pair that I received was in worse condition to the first pair. Definitely been worn with tears in the leather. Dirt marks where the heel sits. Sticker marks left and tape sewn in the stitching. No apology for it happening twice just a returns label emailed for a refund.

Tried multiple times to purchase running clothes online and every time didn't work. contacted an 'athlete' and was told to leave the account for 24 hours still no joy and customer support was closed. Waited another 24 hours and tried again, guess what still didn't work. Contacted customer support yet again and was told to leave the account for 24 hours. By this point I had given up hope and thought worth trying to speak to someone as one last attempt rather than a chat function how wrong I was. The automated function is the single worst thing I have ever come into contact with and talking to a wall would be less frustrating.

Suzann Sime,"For the second time, I ordered from the sale, Nike said it had already delivered one part, as 25% off to purchase 2, so I got the socks I didn’t want separate and delivered asap and then the jacket was seen as ‘delivered’ a lie, and then ‘delayed’ after I called and complained. Again Nike as for the shoes I ordered came both times as Male, despite specifying it needed to be Female sizing as ordered and was assured it would be, 2 male sized delivered trainers later I was forced as already 3 weeks lost and only 30 days to ask for a refund, to request a refund. Again, Nike is buying time to force me into asking for a refund, falsely sending an email saying one of the items was dispatched on the actual day I ordered!!! Be warned, this is what Nike wants, they charge as many people as they can on discounted products, hold the money, but have only a few to distribute and when customers are forced to ask for a refund Nike is off the hook for FALSE Advertising that they have products but don’t. Do not buy any sale from Nike as it will not come, FAIR TRADING U.K. despite a Netherlands based company should stop this. Nike should no longer be able to trade retail or online anywhere in the U.K. my email details on my Nike account has been deleted by Nike! I took a screenshot so I will share this if anyone wants evidence that NIKE said it was delivered on the day ordered but liars! And U.K. registered but no complaints procedures, only put into feedback, no one you can contact how can the U.K. fair trading office know this is going on and allow it?! 15 days later, I received another email from NIKE saying that the item no longer is available, no surprise there with FALSE ADVERTISING their products and still NO MONEY REFUND, this is a new way NIKE is operating, take your money, keep it, make interest on it probably and then don't deliver the goods.",02 August 2023,GB

I was refunded back to the gift card, but still am getting the same error messages, but this time when I called they couldn't place the order for me either.

I swear if the shoes I want are out of stock when this issue finally gets fixed I will delete my account, sell my gift cards and never buy another Nike product again. I've been buying Nike products for well over 30 years now but having thus many problems that not even the team members can do anything to help is crazy.

Tara,"I accidentally ordered two pairs of the same trainers for my child on the Nike website on 11 August, but one was the correct size and one was a smaller size. I called immediately to cancel the wrong order and the customer service advisor cancelled the trainers that I wanted. When I told her what she'd just done, the line went dead - she'd hung up on me, presumably because she knew she'd made an error! And when I called back it was too late to cancel the other order. I was sent a form to give feedback, but I've had no apology about this incident.I then tried to rectify the matter by ordering the trainers again on 17 August. The payment went through (it says 'Nike' on the payment on my bank statement, so definitely not a scam site), but no confirmation order email was sent. I called Nike two days later -  the customer advisor asked for my order number. I didn't have it, as I hadn't received the confirmation order. He used my email address (the only one I have, so I couldn't have used an alternative) to track the order - no trace of it. The advisor suggested the payment is probably only pending (it wasn't) and to use the Nike app instead, ""as this kind of thing can happen on the website but not the app"", according to the advisor. So I've paid almost £60 and have no way of getting those trainers or the refund through Nike. Worse still, I've had to order the flipping trainers again! Thankfully, they are here and my child likes them - and I've returned the order that the advisor should have cancelled. Now I'm just waiting to get my money back on the order that Nike customer service can't trace. I have sent a complaint email to Nike about this, but I haven't heard anything back, so I called Nike again today (25 August) - just in case the first advisor was a total idiot, but the second advisor couldn't trace the order either. I told her that I hadn't heard back from my complaint email and she said that's because the only way you can complain is through providing ""feedback"", which she can then pass on to a supervisor. I did this, I expect to hear nothing as Nike is clearly a rubbish company in terms of customer service.It really is outrageously disgusting - how can you take someone's money, not provide the product and not be able to trace the order? I've had to go through my bank to get the money back. Obviously I will get it back, but it's a hassle and so unnecessary. This is why I hate online shopping!!!You have been warned!",17 August 2023,GB

Consumer,I bought a pair of Nike Air Max Ltr in Black. I've been wearing these type of trainers for years until now. I've had 3 pairs this year and the trainers stink of cat pee or something there disgusting. My feet are extremely healthy and don't stink at all until i put these on. Maybe there using cheap glue or something? other trainers i have are fine. The tread doesn't last as long either. After all these years of buying Air Max 90 i think its time change from Nike £144.00 for Stinky trainers and had 3 pairs from the beginning of the year. £432.00 on trainers and the year isnt even out yet. There not daft and wont be buying from nike again they should be ashamed of themselves really as a branded company.,21 August 2023,GB

It took another 5 day to refund me , I spoke to nike rep she apologised and said to reorder as lots in stock,  so I did another 200 euro 4 days later these to were cancelled, saying out of stock.

Eimear O'Sullivan,I would give zero stars if I couldI tried contacting the customer service number about an issue with my order and it takes FOREVER to get through to an actual human you can talk to. The automated message makes you read out your order number and name before they'll connect you and they kept repeating the wrong number and name back to me. Could be avoided if you just get put through to a person to begin with. Then was put on hold for a few minutes and then the call just disconnected so I had to ring again 3 times before I finally got through to someone and having to repeat the same thing of talking to a robot and having to repeat myself over and over until they got the order number and name right.

She did refund the 30.00 for the unfulfilled service, but it is frustrating as heck, when a company can promise anything, and not have to fulfill their promise. This isn't the first time it has taken longer to receive my order, and that was why I paid for express service. To top it off the 30.00 refund will not be in my for 7 to 10 days, it only took them 3 seconds to take it out of my account.

(who are apart of the JD Sports corporation) aren't an 'authorised retailer' so they're unwilling to do anything about it, leaving me £108 (after discount) out of pocket, as the shoes are unwearable.

Gordon Stobbart,"Ordered 2 pairs of Nike Air Kukini SE for about £55 each. One, Blue and one Black Splatter colour in the sale. From a comfort point of view, they are very comfortable for walking and easy to slip on as they are laceless and fit true to size. The design is nice in these colours, but this is where there is an issue. The quality of the product is poor. The rubber outsole is poorly joined to the upper. The quality of the rubber, webbing and material is low grade. The black splatter trainers had a chunk out of the back of the rubber outsole. I wud have sent them back, but I had white acrylic paint and painted over it. Fit and comfort 9/10. Quality 6/10. I have also bought 2 pairs of Jordan Stay Loyal 2. Which are probably the best designed and high quality trainers, I've ever owned for a tenner more in the sale. Even the box was amazing, black with a gold jordan motif.

They then tend to register one product in return, leaving me to pay over 10000NOK on goods that's been returned. They do this in hopes we don't have the SMS receipt (proof of sending the package in return) from Postnord so they can charge for goods you've returned. Twice his has happened and only with big orders that has value, never with smaller orders with much less value. They're very sneaky, looking for the opportunity to hustle you.

However i am consistently asked to send this again. I started this process in early May (3 Months) 20+ chats 6 Phone calls and two times senior members of staff were supposed to contact me which they do in an initial email requesting all of the information they already have on file and when i iterate this to them that is the last i hear from them and they do not respond to any further emails and i have to start all over again.Its quite simple really give me a refund or give me an equivalent pair of trainers, it seems as though Nike must have a policy of rejecting applicants for jobs with IQ’s above 89.",08 May 2023,GB

El,"I wish to share my experience with Nike's customer service regarding the purchase and refund of a faulty pair of tennis shoes. The process proved to be frustratingly complicated, filled with inconsistencies and miscommunications from Nike's end.When I sought a refund for the faulty shoes, I was led to believe that I would receive a cash refund. Instead, the refund was credited back to a gift card I had used, due to a miscommunication by Nike. This initiated a time-consuming exchange to rectify this mistake.Different customer service representatives provided varying explanations, and it took significant effort on my part to achieve resolution. Nike finally agreed to refund me as I had initially understood, but labeled it a 'one-time exception', not acknowledging it as a correction of their error.When I sought additional compensation for the inconvenience, I was told the provided compensation was 'sufficient'. This felt dismissive given the time and energy I spent correcting Nike's mistake. This case dragged on > 1 month.Nike's current Trustpilot score of 1.6 stars, with over 5000 reviews, echoes my dissatisfaction. For such a reputable brand, the level of customer service is disappointing. My advice to others would be to ensure all agreements with Nike are written and confirmed via email and be prepared for a potentially lengthy resolution process.Or, shop elsewhere if you can!",01 June 2023,GB

After asking her to just cancel the order she said ok she will do so and then just hung up on me .

After placing the order on 12th July I received an email confirmation for the order and just waiting on the dispatch email, day’s pass and on the 18th July called customer service complete joke and waste of time she just said it will arrive tomorrow, tomorrow arrives the 19th July still no email called that morning another advisor said yes it’s being delivered today so waited called on Thursday 20th July had to call twice just to explain that I’m leaving Belfast please cancel down order so I can get my gift card back to buy one in store she said yes she would do it and it would take 24 hours I said that’s fine as I will wait 24 hours goes to store and guess what nothing has been done so had to pay full amount again via my bank as no gift card back nothing refunded and obviously 🙄 I’m still wanting to give a present, anyways thought it may just be an oversight and called on Monday 24th July explained everything to the advisor and she said I’m going to speak with my manager see what we can do because it was meant to be cancelled down and I have had to pay for a 2nd tracksuit and it’s been nearly 2 weeks since I placed the order, so she comes back and said look because it’s our error completely and you have purchased a 2nd tracksuit etc we are going to suspend the gift card from the original order and refund your full money to your card ending **** so I clarified this with her 3 times to make sure that all the money was going to my bank account and she said yes definitely that was on Monday 24th July and she even said this may take up to 48 hours so I’m going to give you a call back on Wednesday 26th July to make sure everything has went as it should have, I’m thinking great at last and they are putting in my bank account so I have used the gift card in an around about way. Well yesterday being Tuesday 25th July here comes the email’s 1 for a gift card and 1 for the bank account and I’m like what is going on so called them and the customer service is the worst I have ever experienced 1st call waste of time and he was so rude I said I want to make a complaint as I want my money as promised not another gift card and he was basically like tough that’s how you paid for the first order and was trying to explain everything to him and he just said we have been on the phone for 17 minutes and we don’t have a complaint’s procedure and stated I’m disconnecting the call and hung up so had to call back again and this time she started with yes it’s all going into your bank account the full amount they just need a bit more time and I said but I have had an email for something about refund processed to a gift card and she was like oh hold the line she had me holding for 10 minutes and came back on the phone to say yes the advisor on Monday requested it to your bank but they haven’t done that and they have processed it now so it can’t be changed so said to her I want to speak with a manager she said that’s not possible then I said it states at the start of the call “all call’s are recorded” so I want mine listened too and a formal complaint made she said we don’t do that its just feedback we take, so honestly I’m cracking up by now and saying to her look I just want my money back and she like but you have it on the gift card and I’m stating but it’s not meant to be like that but honestly she didn’t care she also said to me we have been on the phone 38 minutes (this must be a thing Nike teach advisor’s) and I said to her that’s because you are not listening to me or helping me and have put me on hold for a long period of time several times and she said well I’m going to end the call because you have a gift card now. So it’s now been 48 hours and surprise NO the advisor from Monday hasn’t called me back and obviously 🙄 I still don’t have my money and by that I mean the money to my bank account as agreed because do Nike really think I’m going to order again after this!!! This company need’s to take a long hard look at how staff are dealing and treating the customer’s who are buying the item’s that keep them in the job, review the complaint’s procedure and finally stop ripping people off by not giving us the item’s we pay for and just keeping our money as a gift card is not the same!!!! So long story but worth paying attention to as you do NOT want to go through what I had too deal with. After reading this review and you still purchase you must be crazy and just want to give your money away but give to a charity instead Nike don’t deserve anything!!! Sorry 😞 rant over.",24 July 2023,GB

Aisha M,"I purchased some shoes , they arrived quicker  then the expected date ! I tried them on only to realise they were far to big in size . I logged on to the website and it said I  can return unwanted purchases at my local Nike store however I wanted to return via online  instead. I rang up the helpline around 5:15pm which was answered by a young gentlemen, I explained my issue and the kind gentleman said that all I needed was a printer as he had emailed me the returns label free of charge and that all I had to do was drop it off at the post office and my refund would be with me within a few days  I was surprised at how quick my issue was dealt with ! I found this service very convenient no hassle and reassuring ! Most definitely will continue keep purchasing from Nike.com ! Thankyou",25 July 2023,GB

Tani Lovely,"I posted a review about my unsuccessful experience with NIKE on July 23, 2023. I had a bad shopping experience at the Nike Fairview Mall in Toronto.  I bought Nike sneakers and the day after the defect was discovered, I asked to exchange them at the store, which the store manager refused to do. After writing my review, Nike representatives contacted me and offered me a Nike card worth twice the amount of my purchase. I was pleasantly surprised because the card was actually sent to me and I was able to use it. I thank Nike for cherishing their name and appreciating their customers.However, now I will only buy Nike products through the website, but not in the store that I indicated, because the stores have their own policies, and in case of defective products they may refuse to exchange the goods.",22 July 2023,CA
Alicia,"I placed an order Thursday 13th July for delivery Saturday 15th July. I had a delivery confirmation saying my parcel was left in a “safe place” it wasn’t there when I checked.Raised the issue with Nike on live chat and told needs an investigation 5-8 working days. Received an email Thursday 20th July asking if received my parcel yet, this was not the case! Contacted live chat again Friday 21st July saying I haven’t received it. They said that the investigation had been done. My parcel was tracked via GPS in the correct location and that is it. Shane who I was speaking with took over 10 mins to reply to me on initial chat and basically said that’s that. Nothing more and popped up saying hope you have a great day, goodbye for now! Again contacted Live chat Friday 21st July  and that it would need raising and to reply to the email I was sent (no reply email address) I was assured I would receive an email again so that it could be personally handled by someone at Nike…. Still waiting Monday 24th July. Asked for a complaints email/number, they don’t have one, there’s no direct contact where that is concerned!Absolutely bewildered, I’m out of pocket and empty handed!! I will be raising a formal complaint and looking to get other agencies involved. Nike you are absolutely shameless and lack any dignity or empathy towards your paying customers.",24 July 2023,GB

On 21st July I received an email to say that they had been delayed. I have just called as I haven’t heard anything & live chat isn’t on only to be told that they cannot fulfil my order.

Jill H,"I recently received an email from Nike for unlocking a £20 reward for being a Nike member. I ordered a Nike tracksuit for my nephew . Bearing in mind I only ordered because I had 20 off. I wouldn’t normally pay £64 for a small kids tracksuit. To cut a long story short Nike apparently don’t have a complaints department so I’m s@&t out of luck. £20 pound was a big deal as I said I never would have purchased the tracksuit. Customer services, if that’s what you want to call them, wouldn’t answer my questions and just keep stating we didn’t send you an email even when I uploaded a copy of the email. I’m fuming. Never again will I purchase from Nike. No help whatsoever. Rude as he kept saying the same thing and ignoring me. Basically not answering when asking to complain. Nike if that’s how you do business it’s shocking. Local businesses are way more helpful these days.",20 July 2023,GB
Victoria Itiberê,"On my latest purchase from Nike, everything went wrong, from the delivery, customer service, opening hours.It started when my 6 y/o nephew asked for a France's jersey with Mbappe's name stamped for his 7th birthday.I searched everywhere without any luck, and finally after talking to Nike's custumer assistance, the person on the other side of the phone recommended me to buy a France blank shirt and print/stamp Mbappe's name on it, and he said that Nike town in London would do this for me.I purchased it on a Thursday and the delivery was supposed to arrive Saturday so I could collect in the evening and go to London Sunday and customise in time. The parcel didn't arrive until next Monday, and as I work from monday to Saturday I couldn't do what I planned because of the terrible service from nike/evri. I travelled on the next Sunday to London to arrive at the shop first thing in the morning, 10 AM is the opening hour advertised on Google. Arriving there, I discovered the store would just open at 12 so I had to wait for two hours and wasting a lot of my time in Oxford st when I was not planning for it (AGAIN).Finally when it opened they told me they could not do what I wanted, that they don't keep the font and numbers for all their kits and that the France ones they didn't have in store since December last year. Their recommendation in store was for me to buy it online but I told them that they don't offer for that size with customisation online because probably it was sold out. My nephew's birthday is in 13 days, and I have lost more than two weeks because of misleading information from Nike and also the money on train tickets for nothing just to end up with an expensive shirt that is not exactly how he wanted. I will return this purchase to Nike and will never be buying anything from them again",02 July 2023,GB
Emilia,"Read all the reviews here, they never give the money back. On top of that, I wrote a couple of reviews on their website, and guess what? They deleted them! Nobody is able to help via phone or chat. They are simply keeping our money. Frustrating! Awful customer service, terrible terrible. NEVER AGAIN. Returned items in May... still waiting for my money.

Rachit Verma,"Ordered 2 pairs of shoes a week ago which were meant to be delivered 2 days ago, still no sign of delivery and Nike refuse to refund my money until their investigation is over even though they publish 30 days returns in bold on their website. Never expected such an experience from a brand like Nike, no complaints department in the UK, customer service copy pastes verbatim, no human element, utter crap. I would suggest everyone not to use their website and order from then directly, their delivery Company is Evri (so called new Hermes) and we all know their reputation in the UK market.I have now been asked to wait 5-8 days to wait for a resolution but I doubt looking at previous recent reveiws out here, there's definitely some scam going on here in the UK with customers not receiving their orders.",17 July 2023,GB

Matthew    Collister,Used to love their products but now their quality is very poor ( even for the high end running gear ) They also inflate their prices to allow for discounts on your birthday for example to make you feel like you’re getting a good deal. I will never buy from them again for running gear - cheap quality and to be honest I’m happy to see elite runners now using other brands who are far more kinder to their loyal customers. I used to spend 100s a month on Nike products and now it will be a big fat zero!,15 July 2023,GB

Matthew Beatty,"I received a delivery today from Nike, I ordered two pairs of Air Jordan 37 as a gift.  Both boxes were damaged and one was missing the outer sleeve, subsequently I contacted the Nike experts and to be honest although polite, the representative continued to refer to the seniors.  The outcome was merely that the packaging isn't part of the pricing of the shoe so they were unable to do anything but return.  The issue I had was that I would of been left giftless for relatives birthday's and also the inconsistency and lack of empathy for the situation was very poor.  This is not what I have previous expected from Nike's level of customer service, so missing packaging and damaged packing is not recognised as an issue, something I have never experienced with other retailers.Very disappointed with Nike for the first time.",10 July 2023,GB
Tomáš Korec,"Terrible experience. I have ordered shoes for my elder father. The size did not fit, so I tried to return the shoes.NIKE should organize the pickup (my father is not able to ship the shoes himself because of his age), so we have printed the labels which we received from NIKE, but nobody came to pickup. After call they told us to do the process again and if nobody comes, they will refund us either way. This repeated 4 times, I have spend hours on phone with them, they always promised to refund us, but after faild pickup, it was still ""let´s try again"". My father spend days waiting for pickup at home. I did not expected this from company like NIKE.",10 July 2023,CZ

Verena,"I tried to make an online order at Nike.com. The order contained 6 pairs of shoes and over 580$ of value. I submitted the order and a day later I received an email from Nike saying that they had cancelled the order and I should contact customer service.  Customer service tells me that my billing information didn’t match and that the order was declined by they billing team. Solution: I had to do it all over again - no support from their end by just re-submitting the order. This is what every half established business does these days. Ok so I put in the time again, searched for all shoes again in the size, put them into my card and this time used PayPal as a payment method as they had told me that the order was declined bc of my credit card before. Doing this I realize that some of the items didn’t had the discount on it they had the day before. So I reached out to Nike customer service again and they said that they will apply it after I submit my order again. So I stayed on the line with customer service - again- for about 45 min. One day after this, I receive AGAIN an email from Nike saying that they had cancelled my order and that I should contact customer service. Guess what? Customer service recommends just submitting the order again. As a summary: spend 2,5h talking to Nikes customer service with zero help or outcome, 1200$ blocked on my credit card and no solution. Super unprofessional! Instead of training your customer service people on how to small talk and make compliments on the selections etc. You should first cover the most important - actually providing a valuable solution to your customer. And this can’t be telling them to do the same thing they already did, because that clearly failed. Learning: I am buying Adidas and New Balance sneakers from now on.",07 July 2023,DE

pavel rodideal,"I have just recieved my Nike by You shoes, air force 1. I have another pair bought from the official Nike store in the town i live. And i can say this: the ones from the store are great. The Airforce 1 by You are garbage. Yes. Garbage. Leather does not even feel like real leather.( maybe because it isn't real leather) after 7 hours of wearring in the office :))))) they look much worse than the pair i have from the original store since 1 month and i weared them almost daily. I compared the leather on the Nike by You pair with some cheam shoes made in Romania that sell for less than 50 euro  and the romanian shoes leather is better than the one used on the Nike by You shoes. I don't know what to say and what to think about this. I allways tought Nike are the best. I had only great experiences with nike since forever until now. The conclusion is I payed more for a pair of shoes that are much less compared to the cheaper and much more durable that i have bought from the store. I have a pair of Nike i payed 50 euros in 2016 and still look good after n machine washes, they are still wearable. But Nike by You does not seem to last more than 2 months before they litteraly break apart so my conclusion stick with original nike shoes from official stores that you can check before buying",30 June 2023,RO
Angela Clainos,"Husband and I each bought a pair of the same shoe. After wearing them for around a year, both shoes cracked in the frame at the back and the sharp edges digging into our heels made them impossible to wear. Nike supposedly has a 2 year claim policy for this sort of quality issue. Sent them both in for a refund claim and it has been the biggest nightmare I have ever had to deal with.The first pair of shoes were assessed and I received a gift card for the amount we paid. Tried to use the gift card, system said it has £0. Contacted Nike who say the gift card has been used (by whom???) and refuse to give me a name or any details about the order, even though that is considered theft. More than likely used by a Nike employee with access to this info.5 months later I am still contacting Nike about the second pair which I was informed today ""are in the warehouse being checked"". There is no one to escalate to. Every single one of the 10 agents I have spoken to over chat promise they will message their colleagues who are dealing with the case and they will get back to me. No such thing.Basically if you have a claim against your Nike shoes, don't put yourself through this pain. Just throw them out, agree to never go near the brand again and move on to Adidas or New Balance who have better looking shoes anyway. Michael Jordan made Nike famous, but he can't keep Nike famous forever, especially with this awful quality and shocking customer service.",30 June 2023,GB

Kim Weinmeyer,"My son and I ordered soccer boots. Paid extra to get them here quicker as he really neeed them fast. When his order arrived; they were not soccer boots; they were a regular pair of shoes. My son sent the order back, and then ordered his shoes again. After a few weeks of not getting refunded he contacted Nike. They asked him to provide proof of return. My son did what they had asked, and showed them his return receipt from Canada post. A few weeks later he got an email stating that they are declining his refund because they cannot find the shoes. I spent many hours on the phone trying to talk to someone. They tell me that since it already went to the return investigation team they cannot help me. Shame on you Nike, first of all... this wouldn't have even happened if you all just sent the right shoes in the first place. Second of all, do you really think we are trying to scam you out of money when he ordered another pair immediately after? Third, you are a multimillionaire company. People work hard for their money. This is rediculous and down right STEALING from your customer.",01 May 2023,CA
Rizzy Khan,Tried to deliver to wrong address left a pick up card at wrong address my neighbour from across road. when I contacted Nike they had no clue contacted Evri they had no clue what had happened or why my parcel was left 5miles away at a shop from my address they told me a investigation would take place with them selves and Nike and I have to pick up my item or start a return. So I started a return with Nike then my neighbour goes and picks up my parcel a few days later thinking it’s his having no name or address on card when he saw my name on parcel he was very angry driving so far out the way realising it’s not even his parcel there was no name no address on card. Nike and Evri again didn’t know what’s going on or where the parcel has gone or how somebody could pick it up with out being me. Nike is the worst company I have ever dealt with customer service is really poor no help not a clue how to deal with situation on top very rude asked 5 times for someone to contact me no response every time all I got told where  lies about call back from a manager today every time  which never happened till this day Evri and Nike as bad as each other both clueless of what was going on or happened it has been over a month never heard anything from Nike still Never buying Nike again for me or my kids,17 May 2023,GB

I tried to return the shoes and was told it was out of the two year manufacturer window. Ok i get it but my point was this shoes is brand new i did not wear it more then five times and a 200$ shoe that imploeds that quickly should be replaced.

I was told an investigation was raised twice but that I would not receive a refund for the kit that was not packed with the other items.Due to the poor service I have received I have returned the rest of the order.

I have tried to order on two separate occasions trainers for both which are a couple of months apart to first email to say delayed and when I contacted the company to be told they are out of stock. Yet still could be purchased online? I spoke to customer service of which he was the rudest person who basically told me that he could do nothing about it. Bit of a joke really. For such a big company something as simple as stock checking between store and warehouse to be so bad. Really bad experience, been let down twice with the same issue.

Leanne Woodhams,"Absolutely disgusting Company. I ordered the wrong size clothes for my son at the end of May, so sent £133 worth back untouched and ordered them again in a bigger size. The return has been ""lost"" at the warehouse. The company have not had the decency to contact me to update me with where the parcel is and where my £133 is (I've called them 3 times and there is no option to email). Despite me having proof of return and and evidence that the parcel was received, no body is bothering to resolve the issue for me or keep me updated. It's now been 3 weeks and not a peep from them. I will be making a complaint to trading standards. Fortunately my bank are assisting me with this investigation and returning my money. Which is good because it is needed for my sons birthday. Will never be using Nike again. Such a disappointment. All other big brands are able to treat their customers with respect and not scam them, take their money and ignore them. DISPICABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. This brand is going down the pooper. Run while you still can.

Its been 6 weeks and after numerous dealings with the their useless customer service agents that act like NPC's and senior managers that promise call backs but never actually contact you, I've received no answer what so ever.The parcel is clearly lost/stolen and they are not willing to do anything about it, they even told me to get in touch with Evri to start a claim. How can the sender tell a customer to start a claim when it should be them? I've never experienced such stupidness from a company as huge as Nike. For anyone thats experiencing the same issue, just start a chargeback with you bank and stop wasting time with these useless incompetent clowns.",15 June 2023,GB

Richard Dickinson,Placed original order with Nike on 5th May.  Unfortunately they choose to use EVRI as a delivery partner who returned the order to Nike after only 2 failed delivery attempts to a pick up locker.  At the point Nike refunded me straight away so I placed a subsequent order on 12th May having to change 1 product as now out of stock.  On 15th May got email saying issue with delivery and they would contact me when my order would be dispatched.  10 days later and no contact.  So I contact them.  After lots of contact with customer services managed to get them to cancel my order but told I would need to wait 10 days for a refund.  While waiting I asked for case to be escalated to a manager.  Was told this would need approval.  Waited longer and no contact.  Called again and got told my escalation had been approved and I would be contacted within the next 48 hours.  No contact made so chased again.  Got told I was going to be emailed by said manager because their phone was not working.  Received email which I replied to but no response from them in a week.  I am still waiting for a refund over a month later and was told yesterday my order should show up as cancelled and I will get my refund in the next 9 days.  This has now been over a month.  This is absolutly ridiculous as order was meant to be a present for my son for the effort he has put in for sitting his A levels - his first exams due to the pandemic.I will never shop directly with Nike again and the fact this cannot be escalated and dealt with by a manager is absolutely ridiculous.  Nike need to take a long hard look at these reviews and do something about it before they ruin the company!,05 May 2023,GB
John Gardner PT,"Absolute poor and shocking customer service! A faulty pair of trainers that cost £280 and they won’t exchange them even after admitting their is a fault, only thing they can offer is a gift card for what I paid and I can purchase again even though the trainers are £80 more expensive now but somehow that is on me to pay because I purchased from an authorised dealer! Manager refused a call back as their terms and conditions state gift card not exchange so customer will be out of pocket! Out of principle the trainers will be thrown in the bin rather than getting anything else and promoting the brand! Now I’m 1 person and makes zero difference to a company like Nike however people should be made aware of the misleading and pathetic terms and conditions as they are pointless and sound great “oh 2 year warranty” but in reality that means absolutely nothing!

MARK CAMPBELL,"Purchased trainers online, trainers didn’t fit so I arranged my return via the Nike portal and was supplied qr code for the post office.The two pairs of trainers where sent from Nike in one outer box, I used the same box and placed both pairs/boxes of trainers in the outer box.Sealed the box, dropped at the post office and kept my receipt of proof of purchase.A few days passed and I received a email to confirm return, only one pair had been refunded.I contacted nike and they advised they had only received one pair. Told me to wait a few days for the other pair to be scanned.A few days passed and still no refund for second pair, I was then told by nike to send my proof of postage.Sent my proof of postage and was told they would investigate…A few days later I received a email to confirm outcome of investigation and was told after a thorough search of warehouse they could not find my return, would not be refunding me and to make a claim via Royal Mail.Unable to make a claim via Royal Mail as nike supplied the postage.Back to nike only to be told they can’t refund due to decision of senior team and when they receive the trainers only then will they refund me.I HAVE PROVIDED YOU PROOF OF POSTAGE THAT SHOWS THE WEIGHT OF RETURN SO I HAVE CLEARLY RETURNED BOTH PAIRS YOU NEED TO REFUND ME.HOW CAN TWO PAIRS OF TRAINERS BE SENT AND YOU ONLY RECEIVE ONE PAIR? Surly should someone have intercepted my parcel they wouldn’t of just took one pair and tapped the parcel back up for it to continue its journey to nike returns department.Suddenly investigation was reopened with senior team and I received a refund with a 10% discount of future order.Haha you can stick it, disgusting customer care won’t be shopping nike again.

Karen Sexton,"After purchasing Nike trainers, wearing them and discovering a band of hard plastic in the heel which made my foot bleed I decided to return them for a refund using the pre paid label, BIG MISTAKE! Trainers were confirmed received by Nike the first week in February and confirmed they are faulty I am still attempting to negotiate a refund! the chat service is beyond useless! Unbelievably frustrating, have contacted them on a weekly basis still nothing. I have now asked for them to return them to me and I shall take them to a shop to be refunded. Still waiting for the shoes and told I have to wait! The customer service department apparently cannot contact the warehouse for updates. I highly doubt I will get them back, I doubt they even know where they are. Don’t bother using the pre paid return service, from my experience and seeing similar reviews you are unlikely to see a refund or your item returned! Will never buy from Nike again!Update! Still no refund and apparently my trainers have been recycled!Update!

Michael G,"Amazing and influential marketing and overall design team! Product and support…. Couldn’t be worse if they tried!  A company of and for China as CEO stated. It shows in the quality. I am done with Nike forever. Poor construction is poor construction. Unevenly made shoes made of cheap plastic and cheap leather. All for profits sake. I have read many making the final choice to never bury again. More people need to be fed up and at least try other brands to see what they are missing when purchasing from Nike. I could not be more disgusted at my last four to five purchases! It took that many bad shoes and experienced to get out of my marketing and advertising slumber. I am now wide  awake, and I am  well aware of how I have been cheated. I will not mention the other brands I have tried and found superior by a mile. None are made in china, is all I will say. Not an advert for others. Just a fact. Nike shoes are uncomfortable and do not look or function  like the marketing states. Glued and stitched together poorly: cheap materials will never live up to design and marketing goals! At this point I don’t care if Nike wakes up.

James,"NIKE customer service does not offer any assistance other than to tell me to wait for my refund. When I stress there is clearly an issue with my return I am told a senior team will ""investigate"" and contact me - they never do. This has been some of the worst service I have ever received. Now they won't offer me any further assistance.I returned an online order 23 days ago using a supplied pre-paid label and still do not have a refund. Every time I have chased NIKE regarding this I am told I need to wait for them to receive the returned package, when I have explained that I have made the return but the item is not tracking beyond my drop off I am told a senior team will ""investigate"" and contact me - they never do.It looks like the return package is lost or stolen because it has not moved from drop off and NIKE have not received it. Now NIKE supplied me the pre-paid returns label so the contract for shipping is between them and collectplus. NIKE do not agree and is now telling me to make a claim with collectplus. Collectplus have told me I need to take it up with NIKE!When I pushed online chat for an answer from the senior team I am also informed that they have ruled that the return label does not show the package weight so they do not accept my photo evidence (which they asked for) so won't refund - THEY SUPPLIED ME THE LABEL! How is it my fault it doesn't show the weight?! I don't understand the weight on label issue, perhaps NIKE thinks I am trying to defraud them but I have sent the package back exactly as I received it and have an e-receipt to prove it - what else can I possibly do?!So I'm caught in a loop and out of pocket for a lot of money. NIKE won't refund until they get the return package, the return package is lost/stuck, NIKE won't help with this, collectplus refer me back to NIKE. Now I have to pursue this with my credit card and the consumer watchdog.Terrible, terrible service.",13 June 2023,GB

Green,"Just read Rohaan Aftabs review of 7 Jun ‘Nike denying refunds when you successfully return items’ I too have just had the same experience. Returned item utilising Royal Mail 48hr tracked label Nike provided. Have proof of postage, proof of weight, and proof of delivery utilising the RMail tracking code. Nike firstly informed me no parcel had been returned. After repeated calls, online chats requesting the refund and sharing all my proof, I’ve now been told an empty box arrived at the warehouse. I was told same info as Rohaan, that I needed to contact RMail to dispute this. I did complete paperwork for a RMail dispute (this will take 30 days) but know the end result will be the same as Rohaan’s experience since the return label was provided by Nike, THEY need to follow up with their preferred courier, in this case RMail, not we as the Nike end customer. I have proof of the weight of the box at the time of dropping the parcel at the RMail office but repeatedly get told by Nike I dropped off an empty box?!. I have now also had to complete an online form with my bank to try to recover the refund Nike owe. Nike are like talking to a hard, cold wall. At the start of an interaction you go from ‘thank you for being a member’ to, when asking for the refund ‘we will end the chat now and help other customers who actually need our support‘. This was my first and last order form Nike. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS ORGANISATION",08 June 2023,GB
Mrs Reznor,My experience with Nike has been good. Orders have been delivered correctly and on time. I particularly LOVE the custom Air Max’s and Air Force One’s I designed and purchased. I guess my only gripe is the prices. Why do I invariably find Nike items cheaper at other reputable online stores? Third party retailers need to add their cut to the prices in order to make a profit so how can they sell cheaper?! The answer is presumably that Nike are making massive profits out of us. I’ll continue searching other retailers before purchasing directly from Nike.,12 May 2023,GB
Rohaan Aftab,"So after seeing a few people with the same return problems I will share my experience. I returned part of my order in late march, the item was returned, however nike are claiming they have not received it. They advised me to contact royal mail to get a refund so I messaged royal mail support on twitter asking where my return was and they stated that ''Due to the length of time that's passed since it was posted, it would now be considered lost'', they also said that as the service used was tracked returns, Nike should work with royal mail and refund me. However, i then went back to nike with this information and was shockingly told that NOTHING could be done as they have ‘ not received my return’. Essentially, nike told me to contact royal mail for a refund and royal mail told me to contact nike for a refund so I am completely stuck. I did EVERYTHING perfectly as I should, I had the QR code scanned at my local post office, packed the items securely and kept a drop off/ proof of sending receipt safe.I then opened a PayPal case which was closed in Nikes favour some how but luckily American express with the best customer support and protection in the game closed a claim in my favour. This was probably the worst return experience I have ever had and after 5+ years shopping with Nike I will be staying well away from returning and purchasing online. Also I may add they have ABYSMAL CHAT SUPPORT. It’s a shame because their clothes are genuinely good but my lord stay away from online returns, shameful from some a large business whereas adidas on the other hand I’ve never had a bad experience with.",07 June 2023,GB

I've been waiting for months to order the panda Dunks, when they came back in stock I ordered them straight away and they were estimated to be delivered by Evri 2 days later. I then didn't receive them and the tracking link said they'd been diverted and would be delivered the next working day. It's now 10 days after the original delivery date and after getting in touch with Nike they concluded they are ""lost in the post"" and wanted to refund me or I could wait 10 days to investigate it with Evri. They've  plainly been taken by someone at Evri and this is obviously happening a lot from reading reviews below. is very disappointing from a company that is this big that they aren't bothered about sending what I've ordered. They also couldn't send a replacement as they're now out of stock and couldn't advise me when a restock would be. I missed drops on other websites too as I trusted Nike to deliver me what I ordered.

I was waiting for Air Jordan's 14 Laney to be released for over tge year and when they finally released them the sneakers weren't available in Europe. This is such a discrimination and it's really shame that Nike discriminate some markets. Now the same sneakers can be purchased only on Stockx or Kicks for more than double the price plus delivery costs and additional customs costs. This is so unfair and discriminating and I'm thinking to delete my Nike account and move to Adidas or some other brand even though I don't like their products but at least they don't discriminate anyone.if there was 0 I'd give it as as score because of that discrimination.,01 June 2023,IE

Ella O,"I ordered metcons in store at Nike Mt Gravatt knowing they would post them out to my address as they didnt have my size or coloir. They advised my shoes would arrive by Wednesday from their Brisbane store. I called Nike Mt Gravatt and spoke with Supratik Friday afternoon (1 week after paying in store). He happen to be the one that I originally paid and ourchased from the prior week so knew my order. I let him know I had not received them. He chased up what happened and called back to apologise that their Brisbane store accidentally sent it to them at Mt Gravatt store instead of my home address. He did give me the option of refund or to ship it out or I could pick up. As I was wanting to use my shoes I opted to pick up in store. However, I arrived and they had the wromg colour. I ordered black They had white. They checked my order and apologised as they had requested the correct colour but said their Brisbane store sent the incorrect colour. By then it didn't matter which store was at fault. I had wasted my time and money to drive 30 kms to collect shoes that weren't there. I am still without shoes. Frustrated with the service provided and basically not a happy customer. I have had previous online orders through my Nike login with no issues which is why I expected the same with this order.

Jules,"I am a collector of Nike (mostly) trainers in the UK. My husband bought a pair of Nike Motive training shoes, new model, looked fantastic online etc. Always had a great experience previously. HOWEVER, When they arrived this morning, they came in a box. I opened it up, expecting to see another (the real) trainer box inside. Instead, ALL I SAW WERE THE TRAINERS, NO INTERNAL BOX. So, I wouldn't mind as much (well being a collector I probably would mind), if the costs Nike have saved were passed on to us, the customers. As a real purist where my trainers are concerned, I am literally disgusted that they have cut these out of their products. I love the packaging, always keep it all as good as I can, always put my trainers back in the box at the end of the day and look after my sneaks. I mean, Nike must save LOADS by not giving boxes out. I am quickly going OFF Nike!! I understand we are trying to save the planet but I do feel they are going a bit far here and using that as an excuse to cut their costs and still charge the customers as before. I have already ordered another pair for myself. I did this before I received this pair - I probably wouldn't have ordered anything more from Nike as I feel let down by them now!",31 May 2023,GB

Sarah Carnell,"Firstly I am surprised by all the bad reviews, I have always had great customer service from them. The staff have always gone out of their way to help me. I had to send a pair of trainers back that were 6 months old because the fabric tore and they refunded the full amount. I have also had trainers delivered fast and I have a fair few pairs that are great quality. So all in all I would give them 5 stars and the customer service is better than most company’s.",31 May 2023,GB

Patrice,"Nike website is rarely up to date with actual items available. Always allowing you to place order, and then days later emails you to say order has been cancelled, prompting you to contact them if this is an error. Of course it’s an error i ordered it and YOU cancelled it. Customer rep informs me the item i order is low or out of stock and they can’t place a new order. So why was i allowed to place it in the first place? This is the third time I’ve experienced this poor service from Nike. Sitting on millions but can’t update inventory on their website, causing thousands of customers frustration when they believe they have ordered a product that is in fact sold out. And the email informing me of the cancelled order gave me zero insight. Wasting more of my time by having to call customer service. Which led to more disappointment by saying they can’t order the items either.",27 May 2023,US
Youssef,"If I can give 0 stars I would. I’ve been a customer over 5 years. I ordered shoes and now they said my shipper lost it. Laura gave me there number, so I called and the shipper said that nike never sent it out. I called back and the manager didn’t even want to speak to me. I told Laura don’t issue me a refund because I need to talk to a manager. I hung up the call and she issued a refund after tellin her three times don’t. Worst fkn company to buy from at this time. I’ll never purchase from nike again. Zero customer courtesy they didn’t fkn care. Nobody there cares.",27 May 2023,US
Taz,Nike has gone downhill. The worst customer service ever. After explaining the issue they will simply cut the call. Happened three times in a row.

Will not be shopping with Nike again.,26 May 2023,GB

I even found some poor stitching on one shoe. The customer service offered me 10% off coupon but I bought the pair at 15% off coupon and told me, that I should buy new pair and return old one.

They didn't deliver my order, then blamed it on the courier, and then eventually admitted that they lost the order in transit from their warehouse to the dispatch centre, so it was never actually dispatched in the first place. No apology from their customer service agents, just a constant sense of being brushed off and the Live Chat agents actually cut-off the chat when I tried to raise a complaint about the poor service. They said they would issue a refund but it still hasn't arrived in my account. Really shocked and disappointed by the appalling customer service - not what I would have expected from Nike.

There is no accountability whatsoever. The agents over the phone will hang up on you and the chat advisors are always eager to finish the chat without resolving the issue. Waiting for almost 2 months for a refund when return tracking clearly shows item returned and proof of postage provided too. One of the biggest trainers company in the world like Nike to have such a shocking customer care is beyond me.In the end wrote an email to CEO but no reply either. Where will you go when you have exhausted all the options. SHOCKING.",17 May 2023,GB

Gee Gee,"I have ordered 3 pairs of shoes in one month, all at different times and didn't receive any of them. Delivery status kept saying it's been returned to sender without even attempting to deliver the item, each order tracking shows that it has not been out for delivery. Once Nike receives it they can't send the item back to me and I have to wait 5-8 working days for a refund. The item was sent via DPD and Nike told me that if DPD can't deliver the item that day they have to send the item back to Nike so it doesn't get stolen or damaged. After each refund nike tell me to place another order, only for the same thing to happen again. It's so inconvenient and why do I have to keep waiting for refunds and reordering when the items can just be resent to me? I'm not going to order again, not that it makes a difference to Nike sales but as a Nike member it's makes no difference on the level of service you receive. The system isn't working because as consumers we are inconvenianced, out of pocket and no items. The chosen courier service DPD is letting Nike and their customers down",15 May 2023,GB

A Christou,Don't buy online I bought goods online as I purchased at a 25% discount if I sign up and bought another item half price . They sent the socks but the tracksuit 'got stuck' waited two weeks then they cancelled it and I had to wait 13 days in total to get a refund. Nike expected me buy online again while waiting for a refund of a gift card. So I would end up with spending another 150 and left with another refund of 136 in vouchers. therefore no sale item and spending £300 . No offer of compensation just the same 25% that has to be used online all new customers will get to sign up. I asked for the 25% to be used instore due to the fact they are not trustworthy. They refused.I topped up my voucher to get a further 10% discount they offer. I could have got the tracksuit cheaper elsewhere minus the extra 10 % voucher. Next online store? when something like this happens and you lose out send you a gift card to compensate for the loss Nike don't care about customer care from my experience now and in the past.

Contacted Nike online who promised an investigation. After a week there was no email. Contacted them who eventually worked out the investigation was ongoing. Another week and no email. Contacted them again and after going through the story again said “senior management have looked into this matter and found all both t shirts were sent.

customer,"Communication and response has been very poor after a recent return as a fault claim.  Initially I was pleased with Nike UK who accepted to process my fault claim on Nike trainer bought in the US. I was provided with a returns label for the return stating they would get inspected within 5-7 business days. The trainers were received by Nike on 04/04, I contacted Nike Assist on 18/04 to be told they were with the claims team and that claims take 3-7 working days and inspection takes 5-10 business days. I contacted the Nike assist again on 22/04 to be told it was still with the management team. 25/04 contacted Nike assist (again) to be then told it can take up to 5 weeks to process a claim!! I then decided to contact Nike Assist by telephone (26/04), the previous comms had been through the chat, to be told that I had to provide my bank statement as proof of purchase and that was all they required. This was sent immediately, phoned again on 28/04 to be told to send it as a pdf, I was also informed at this point that the fault claim had been accepted on 10/04. Today (5/5) I have contacted them again to be told they will escalate to a senior member as I requested and a gift card should be processed within 5 days. I asked to speak to a senior manager but was told that was not possible, the operator then put me on hold and spoke to the senior manager!! Apparently I will now have my gift card sent to me within the next 24 hrs.At no point through this claim has Nike contacted me directly to ask for any further information or to provide an update on my claim.  I have had to contact them to progress this claim, if I hadn’t done this I would expect I would still be waiting. I understand that things can take time to progress but why state it will take 5-7 business days and then keep communicating different timescales.I will be surprised if I receive the gift card, this has just been poor communication and customer service and not what I expect from a Global company such as Nike.",03 April 2023,GB

I tried calling the service agent was obstructive when I asked how to make a complaint. Apparently, according to the customer service agent I spoke to, Nike does not have a complaint policy. So, I would suggest not ordering from Nike, as if anything goes wrong, they have no system for you to complain or rectify it. What a joke! Another service agent just put the phone. Nike don't care about their customers, they clearly don't have any expectations of their service agents and I won't be buying from them again.",27 April 2023,GB

Nelson Matias,"After having bought sneakers from nike that are constantly sold out (only the 3rd time I got them and they are already sold out again) the order never arrived at my house because the company contracted to deliver the PAACK product says it has made two delivery attempts when it is a lie because I was at home all day both times.When I received the email informing that the second delivery attempt had been made and that no one was at home, so the product was going to be sent back to nike, I immediately called nike support (Portuguese service number in English) so that they could resolve the subject. In addition to telling me that they could not resolve the matter, the two times I called, the operators were not able to provide me with a telephone contact of the shipping company, they could not find it.Nike's solution: refund the money. I told him that I didn't want the money but the product because it was a gift and that it was very difficult to buy it and the answer was always the same, that as the product was out of stock, they could only refund me.A company with this size should pay attention to the companies they work with.

So I contact them and they say 'oh sorry this is out of stock now but we will refund you'. What e-commerce company immediately puts something back up for sale after one delivery attempt? Why didn't they even attempt a redelivery or try to contact me? Their customer support was not helpful either, with the only explanation given that 'they didn't want the trainers to get stolen' and that 'it might come back in stock' but with no guarantee or anything on timing. The best they could offer was a 10% promo code like that would make up for everything. I'd been tracking these trainers for ages and now I can't find them anywhere.

I requested to raise a complaint and they refused to do so. Informed me that they would send me the complaints procedure and email address via email which they didn't do... the amount of money Nike make out of us as ut actually only costs about £10 to make the trainers and once they slap the tick sign they up the price 10 fold I would have thought that they could at least have a decent customer service department,03 April 2023,GB

We have the real body parts of a born woman and y’all choose to put a born man wanting to be a woman to model woman’s clothing is a low blow, a disgrace to all of us natural born real women and I will let my kids know that they do not buy Nike anymore.

Then, when I viewed the item again, it was in stock and I could once again purchase it, like what? This happened not once, but a few times. Plus, compared to the sports band with three stripes, their products are inferior. I really like that three stripes have usually a more affordable price, but also are much longer lasting. Not only this, but they stand behind their products, whereas nike is like, ye whatever, the whole world is using our products so we don't have to care about singular customers. I also contacted the CEO and basically did not get a reply by the way. Nike? More like NEVER again.",04 April 2023,TR

So they have refused to refund even though I have proof it was delivered but icing on the cake was customer service signing off the email telling me to shop in store in future if I plan to purchase any Nike items.

Not once, has it happened to me three times, when I try the payment via gift card it doesn't go through returning an error code: 98d2586b. Then I contact customer care, they treat me as a test subject why don't you try this and that? This time the customer care agent asked me to try three different browsers by logging out and clearing the cache, creating a new account and doing the same thing on the mobile application, uninstalling, then installing again then doing the same thing. After spending half an hour with them, it still DIDNT WORK. Then they ask me to wait a day. What I see the next day was that a few items that I wanted to buy are out of stock.SERIOUSLY WHAT THE HECK !!!NIKE, why the hell do you give a payment option that doesn't work at all?

I believe it is made from some sort of sustainable material although on the site the description says it's leather. If this shoe is leather, this is the HARDEST, TOUGHEST leather I have ever felt. It could be leather scraps bonded with a synthetic material which NIKE is then labeling as leather but come on. The design of the shoe is nice but if you are looking for quality and comfort, this shoe is not it. Shoe won't stretch and your toes will get corns.",10 March 2023,US

Chris Panikkou,Unfortunately my new pair of trainers were a tad too small. I believe the child that made them needs to be reprimanded and have 20 cents deducted from their monthly wage packet of a dollar. Overall a poor experience due to small hands and a lack of perception from the child labourer who produces 1000s of pairs of trainers for a pittance of pay. No incentive equals a lack of quality from the child labourer. 🧐🤗,26 March 2023,GB

Tae,"I literally just received my babies shoes via mail and not only are the boxes tore up like they’ve been ran over numerous times, but the one pair that I purchased have black scuff marks on them, which they are the all white Air Force Ones. The other pair I purchased are the wrong size AND wrong shoes. Maybe I shouldn’t hold them to a certain standard but I ordered from the actual site. I expect something like this from EBay or better yet DHGate, not NIKE!",02 March 2023,US
Jack,"Bought a pair of Nike vapormax from another store I spent £190 on them for the bubble to pop 3 months in however with them being manufactured by Nike I had the option to send them back for inspection , however they try their absolute best to make you stuck for choices to avoid the inspection for example they dont give you an option to send the shoes back via a scannable qr code returns label , instead they make you go out of your way to print a label off so the post office can scan it, however some people don't have access to printers so I called them asking for advice and they told me there's nothing they can do about it and I'll have to find someone with a printer, so in reality I've wasted £190 on a pair of shoes and I can't do nothing with them, this has happened with 2 pairs of vapormaxs now both in the space of 6 months, really not good quality at all considering you have to pay ridiculous prices for them aswell",02 March 2023,GB

Mrs Sharon Clarke,"In all honesty I have never had any problems with Nike, from customer service through to ordering on line, all items have been well made & packaged. My initial problem is the website, I have been trying for 24 hours to place an order, and it just keeps asking me to please wait patiently. I'm not at all impressed at present, I can't be the only person having this current problem.",28 February 2023,GB
Paul Racer,"Shoddy cheaply made Sneekers. The last 2 pairs of Sneekers I've bought off NIKE, have worn down soles after very little use. I think it's a sly/dodgy Marketing manufacturing ploy to use crappy rubber soles on their Shoes. I've had many other sneekers bought off other famous sports brands. Which will last and get my moneys worth.  But NIKE haven't lasted at all. I Don't drag my feet or have an impared walk or run.. Just cheaply made with a hefty price tag. Never again NIKE..

Stephan Berg,It was easy to shop and the product arrived after over 1 week in New Zealand. Air Jordan's look good. But the box arrived damaged and wet. The shoes were still fine but the Air Jordan 1 box not. This can happen but Nike wrapped the shoe box only in wrapping paper. Nothing else. No bubble wrap or box/cardboard.Only answer of Nike...start as return and reorder,27 February 2023,DE

Jack Daniels,"Returned my trainers to Nike on the 31/01 and they received an empty box on the 02/02 I then sent proof of return and a Royal Mail reference number for this because the CS at Nike are so rubbish they can’t actually do anything themselves and they are still refusing a refund! Even though it’s a prepaid postage label between Nike and Royal Mail. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. The managers never call you back and no one tries to help! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM NIKE AGAIN!Day 7 of no call back but apparently they have tried to call me back but no one can tell me when and what time. It is becoming beyond ridiculous at this point. £57 was all the trainers cost in the sale and Nike are still refusing to give me a refund when I have provided prof of return via receipt from Royal Mail, I have even called Royal Mail myself and provided them with a reference number which the CS agent in Nike should be doing not myself and they’re still refusing to do anything. The managers never call you back I’m surprised if they even have managers. Honestly the worst customer service I have ever received - if I ever manage to get this sorted I will be deleting my Nike account and never shopping from them again. DO NOT USE THE NIKE WEBSITE THEY ARE CONMEN AND WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY WHEN YOU RETURN ITEMS. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM ARE THE WORST OF THE WORST AND WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO NOT HELP YOU.",17 February 2023,GB
Meg,"Placed a big order. 3rd jan, I got a text saying my order will be delivered between 12.46-1.46. At 9.53, I informed them via their link to deliver the parcel the next day as no one will be home all day and night. At 18.09, I got a text saying it has been delivered. It was left on my front door step. When I returned home, the parcel wasn’t there. We live in London, so it isn’t a clever thing to do to leave the parcel unattended outside. Nike escalated this order and rejected the refund saying the DPD told them it was “delivered correctly”. I contacted dpd and they emailed me saying they’ve admitted liability and refunded nike for their costs on that delivery. Nike, for a big company, lied to me to take the money from me and Dpd. Until I showed them evidence, they didn’t refund me. The agents on the phone and assistants on the chat will literally just say “sorry the seniors have denied a refund and that’s it”. Just one assistant, called elena, understood finally and refunded me. what a joke. There is no chance I’m ordering online again!!!",26 January 2023,GB
...,Bought pair of trainers for £150 after approximately 12M wear ( they wasn’t worn everyday) they have all split and ripped they look a mess and not wearable. I was told about Mike’s two year warranty but when contacting they can’t do anything because they was made two years ago so just be aware your warranty doesn’t cover your shoes if they was made before your two years of owning the shoes! Shows the quality is bad if they can sit in a box for a year and break after a year is usage and you can’t use warranty,16 February 2023,GB

No transparency of any kind, until they snare you, take you money, from this moment onwards there is zero support.  If I knew that, I would have never purchase on first place.

I recently ordered a package that did not come. I called costumer service and they issued a return even though I wanted the sneakers and got them for a good price. He helped me put in another order but he charged me more than I originally paid. I find out now that both packages are still coming.

Mr Astwood,Effectively Nike use a call centre to process there complaints and returns and they are just given a Script and probably have nothing to do with Nike itself. I purchased a pair of trainers that fell apart after first use so I contacted them via chat as that is all you can do I was then told I could return them as they were faulty. I was sent a prepaid Royal Mail return label and sent it I then waited 5 days checked the tracking and it said it was delivered they then contacted me and said I sent an empty box which is a complete lie as I have the weight on the receipt which I sent to them and they didn’t respond I then contacted them again and they said there’s nothing they can do and won’t send a refund. So effectively they now have my trainers I sent they have refused me a refund and have called my a lier. I contacted my bank and they said it’s something they can do and are issuing a charge back on my transaction. I recommend doing this if you want your money back I hope this helps. Also it’s pretty easy to report them to trading standard too.,03 February 2023,GB

It’s been nearly 5 months , no refund or e-giftcard. Nike customer service have been fobbing me off. They stole the jacket off us and won’t even return it back to us. EXTREMELY POOR customer service.

Nike customer service said that they could not do an immediate refund and said the the order was going to review panel and it would take at  least 7 business days.

I understand that maybe this shoe needs to be sent in from somewhere else ? Maybe it’s not readily available at a warehouse? Or maybe you guys are backed up ? In my opinion there is no excuse at all. U have the shoe on your website as if it is available. I payed for the shoe as if it was available without the knowledge that it would take forever to even ship. The website is dogsh*t Most of the time I dread ordering from Nike.com cause I know it will take forever so most of the time it’s a last resort. And On top of that your inventory on your website is complete trash.The fact that you can’t go to the actual source , the actual brand Nike , to get there premium selections without being mislead and clicking in the item only to realize that it’s not even in stock is rediculous.  And you have shoes still up as if there in stock and u click on the shoe and then it tells you not available. All Nikes shoe selections have been so bad lately as well. I hope someone Important can see this because I’m actually a huge Nike fan and supporter and at this point I’m frustrated enough to write this to let u guys know that I’m about done with the half a** service and selections.

When we finished checking out it never took the gift card off. I called customer service and spoke to Christopher. He said he would put the $100.00 back in my account. He LIED!!! He never put it back. Very poor customer service and we will never order from here again. THANK YOU FOR NOTHING CHRISTOPHER AND NIKE!!!,17 January 2023,US

Reddix,"My shoes came in broken. Damaged on the back. And not one, no both, the seller has seen it 100%, still sold them to me, something you would not aspect from nike. Ordered them new from the nike.com store. Would think you get the best and finest shoes 160 worth. After being in costumers support with ruth he told me or retour it, or take 15% discount. Not even a option to send me back new ones or give a 30% discount. Sadly I had to agree with this discount. 19 days later and still no discount on my bank. Costumers service this time had me talk with someone called princess, what a joke, I mean are they taking anything serieus there? After a rumble of text with her about information to verify me with her bad care and support she gave me no reason why it's still not on my bank. I could not fill in a complain by her, only give feedback that they throw away anyway. I will never ever ever order on nike ever again. Beautifull shoes, totaly ruined. This is one of the biggest companies in the wold and act like one of the lowest. Always had good feeling with nike. But that's totaly gone now.",29 December 2022,NL

LP,"Terrible website and app experience. Unhelpful customer service. Have tried multiple times to place an order with Nike but just keep getting an error code. Followed the instructions given by the customer service agent who obviously fields the same calls all day and knows full well what she’s advising won’t work. It didn’t. Phoned back and was told it was my fault for using the website and I should download the app! Didn’t really want the app but downloaded it so that I could order a specific football shirt as a present. The app doesn’t work either, just get another error code. Nike clearly don’t care about customer satisfaction as there are numerous reviews of people saying the same thing yet nothing is being done by Nike to improve the situation and, rather than apologise for the inconvenience, customer services scold you for having the audacity to try and spend your hard earned money with them!",16 January 2023,GB

So when the snobby robotic customer service refuse to give my money back when I showed multiple proofs that I sent the item with the return label they gave me I have become stressed, angry and hurt that the company I once loved betrayed me. You were better of calling me a liar and a thief. There is no other reason, logically thinking when someone has spend so much money with you why on earth would he lie about a returned item. Nike are saying they can’t find them item and because there policy they can’t refund me, how disgraceful. I wish I could put the pics of my evidence and the chats and the slow and horrible emails I have received from this company. They don’t care !They stole my money, they gave me a return label that was apparently used already and when I tell them this label was generated by you guys it’s not my fault they again don’t give one. I can’t say how frustrated I am still, I am trying to still get my money back and I won’t give up !Nike you guys are a disgrace for this, a multi billionaire company mugging me off for £144 pounds no way I will quit when I know I am innocent !Nike are the thieves.Started 15/11/2022 - Case still ongoing. FYI - Multiple SLA breaches the reason I am putting my foot down because for two months I have been told to wait.

At first I requested the return because Nike does not make 2 exchanges. so i went to the nike store on oxford street and asked them to change it and they told me they would change it but they gave me the size 4.5 uk.I only realized when I got home. It was very big than Before I sent the sneakers back, I got in touch with nike's chat and the attendant gave me a new return label. now i contact nike and they say they already refund me in november if i'm not mistaken. I asked a recept for the refund and I sad: I have all my bank statements and that there are no refunds from Nike even because the sneakers were exchanged for the right color but the wrong size. My shoes arrived 05/01 with 2 more returns. they have a sneaker left in stock and they don't refund me. They now it’s mine but teu are making my refund difficult  Is it simply a commodity left over from Nike's stock? I want my money back or send me the shoe back and I'll try to exchange it for a smaller size or I'll wear it that big anyway. i want a solution. this is disrespectful to the customer. I get in touch every day and every day the deadlines are different. I just want my money back and that's it. if the chat attendant made an error when sending a return label or if nike from oxford street did not indicate that an exchange instead the regund was made problem is not mine. Nike that resolves itself internally and stops leaving the customer waiting without any solution. what a neglect. I want my money back. This return turned a big headache forMe.

All I wanted was a voucher to be delivered on time and before Xmas. You can not hold a decent conversation with anyone in the company. I have now resorted to sending a message on twitter. My next step will be to raise an issue with trading standards as this company is incompetent to carry out basic customer service.    My list is so long of complaints that I won’t include them here. Do not order anything from this company. They are one of the worse companies I have ever dealt with.,06 January 2023,GB

I did this because I was told it would arrive before Christmas.After waiting and contacting customer services team several times to find out that the 2nd gift card hadn't even been shipped. I requested a full refund on both orders.

I sent a email to Nike informing them about the despicable level of service I had received and that I would be leaving a negative review, it was only then did I receive a response and a apology (with a 15% discount on my next order) as if I would ever purchase from them again.I have been told on 05/01/2023 that my refunds have been issued but will take between 5-9 days to arrive in my account.

Courier then emailed me 5 days later saying that my parcel is not suitable for DPD pickup point collection. I then called nike customer service and they told me i would be given a refund. I explained i do not want a refund but i want the trainers, the gentleman on the phone said this is not possible (although the trainers are available). I asked if i could log a complaint he told me only thing i can do is fill up a feedback form on their website. I asked for an email to make a formal complaint and he said they do not have one. I then asked to speak to a senior manager and he told me that the manager has refused to speak to me….  You took 204£ out of my account 5 days ago… and now no trainers and i have to wait another 10 days or so for a refund. Order number: C01161950202I even asked if they can arrange for me to go and pick them up at a Nike store and he told me this is not possible. Person i spoke to goes my the name of Jan and he gave me this reference number for the call: 75597186. Extremely disappointed as i needed these trainers for a birthday present.

Christina Cumpian,"Took a couple days to get one of the two digital gift cards that I ordered that was supposedly going to be emailed to me in ""approximately 2 hours or less"". After I ordered the digital gift card and hadn't received anything for a while, I was told by a representative that for some reason Nike had canceled the transaction (much to my surprise since I received no email from them indicating that it had been canceled). I also still haven't received the second gift card. It really doesn't make sense to me that as big of a company as Nike is, they can't send digital gift cards automatically after purchase and that their website functions very poorly. The only reason why I paid for digital Nike gift cards in the first place was that I tried ordering shoes with visa gift cards and the website wouldn't accept more than one visa gift card as payment for the transaction. I know better next time to just go to a retailer.*Update: I ended up talking with another chat agent earlier today about still having not received the second digital card I ordered. Through a quick process, the agent sent me another gift card, and oddly started flirting with me afterward (just seemed a little unprofessional and off the wall). Later on, I tried ordering shoes online with the gift cards and kept receiving an error message. I ended up talking to another agent on the phone who, after trying it from their end and talking with a supervisor, was unable to figure out why the transaction wasn't going through. I'm not blaming the agent as she was saying that Nike wasn't giving a detailed description of why the transaction wasn't going through. However, it does go to show how seemingly outdated and dysfunctional the Nike website/order processing system is, which really doesn't make sense with how big a corporation it is.",31 December 2022,US

The most ridiculous part is Nike usually waits until the item is out of stock and just refund you the money but the shoes I wanted had an abundance in stock and STILL couldn’t get them to me.

Still waiting on Christmas gifts that were ordered December 15, long before their Christmas delivery cut-off date - PLUS Paid $20 to expedite shipping..yet still haven't received any of it 2 weeks later. I have called customer service and that was no help. They blamed it on the snowstorm, and yet every other company I ordered from got my stuff here on time. Plus, FedEx still says they have never received the package from Nike. (You can't blame a snowstorm when the package was never actually shipped, Nike.) I will NOT order from them again and will try to cancel this order. As I said, this has happened to me for 3 Christmases in a row: 2020, 2021 and 2022 despite the fact that they guarantee Christmas delivery each time. I'm convinced they are selling items that don't yet exist and then scrambling to catch up. PLUS I just read that they continue to have a poor track record for human rights abuses in their factories.

When they didn't arrive I contacted them again. Was advised that Ruben didn't tell me the truth and in fact they could take up to 9 days. It's now 28th and I still don't have my goods.

Allan Alexander,Awful company. Ordered expensive trainers for Christmas present. Turns out they sent a far cheaper pair. Phoned customer services. Not great have to wait until we see proper trainers back on their on line store then contact them again to organise replacement. On returns told would need to join their on line club to qualify for free returns!! Not happening their mistake. Saga continues with onus on customer. Very poor.,26 December 2022,GB
Brian D,"They don't honor their return and exchange policy. I shipped back an item after calling in and being told it would be exchanged for a smaller size. After they received the item from me, they instead refunded me my money and told me to rebuy the item which is now much more expensive that the sale ended. After several calls and chats with unhelpful and rude customer service reps I'm giving up.Nike wasted my time and money - all they had to do was send me a replacement and they would have made money. Now they get $0 from me and I will avoid ordering from their site moving forward - great job Nike.",26 December 2022,US
Customer,Draws are so unfair to normal customers. Waiting at 8am. Received error message saying I was a suspected bott! Joke.,15 December 2022,GB

David Breheny,Ordererd hoody for Nephews Christmas. Been ordered over two weeks. Status kept saying awaiting pick up. Spoke to customer services on 21 and apparently its been lost in transit.

David Thornton,"Ordered 2 Liverpool tracksuits for our grandchildren and both arrived on schedule, however the colours of the Strike kit do not seem representative of the Liverpool kit, so decided to return it. Sent the item (£89.95) back via Royal Mail 48 Hour tracking which was confirmed as being received by Nikeon 14/12/22, but to date no refund received. Rang the customer service line on 20/12/22 who confirmed they’d received the item but wouldn’t issue a refund until they’d Investigated’ the return. Operator refused to put me through to a supervisor and requested I sent a photo of the RM tracking receipt, which I did. To date no refund received so have created a Resolution centre issue on PayPal. The Nike customer service is a complete joke and I would recommend to anyone thinking of using this company. BEWARE",22 December 2022,GB
Angela Campbell,Would be 0. Atrocious customer service. I ordered trainers for my son with a delivery date of 12th December. Did not arrive. Rang Nike call centre in Egypt (there is no British based help line) There were language barriers. I was told the trainers would be with me within 24hours. Still not received 21 December so rang again. Someone answered but did not speak to me so rang again. The second person said that they were lost and they would give me a refund. I said I did not want a refund as they are a christmas present. She told me she would send another pair and asked me the size. She came back to me to say that there were no 8's so she would give me a refund and I could get another pair and gave me a 20 per cent off. I asked if I could spend this at a shop to which she replied no. I said I cannot order on line as she had told me there were no 8s. She said that I could.  When i finished the call i went on line to see if the trainers were in stock in his size and they were not available.This went on for  some time. I asked for a manager to ring me back and this has not happened. My son does not now have his christmas present. Terrible customer service nd i was repeatedly lied to and will never use Nike again.,21 December 2022,GB
Claire,"My order arrived. The incorrect size in the correct size box. It is now a month later, 3 days before Christmas & I still haven’t got my replacement.

Cat Sss,"Pllleeease stop using Evri to send my parcels. I buy from Nike a lot as I have a trainer business and it always used to be DPD. But now you’re using Evri, my parcels get dumped on my doorstep, some have gone missing, a few have got lost in transit and even with next day delivery they NEVER deliver on time. Gonna have to start using elsewhere for my products at this rate. Please at least give us the option to not have Evri deliver!",21 December 2022,GB
Kristen Harding,"C01155831531You should let customers know BEFORE they place a holiday order, that your holiday season is more than you all can handle. My order was partially received today, and the other child's order is still in Indiana and won't get here before Christmas. This has literally ruined their gift aspect of Christmas, and there's nothing I can do now. You've completely lost a customer to another shoe company with better reviews. I'd give negative stars If I could. This will teach me to read reviews before placing an order. Your reviews are horrible and absolutely reflect your service.",21 December 2022,US
Colm,"Would be zero stars if could! Ordered a gift voucher online almost two weeks ago as a christmas present, meant to be delivered by 19th, still no sign, ring up, rude customer service, hasn’t been sent because and I quote “a plastic deficiency “ within the company… I hadn’t been notified of this delay and offered no alternative but to wait for there to be plastic for cards… ridiculous from supposedly one of the biggest companies in the world",21 December 2022,GB
Beth,"What went wrong? Let's try to figure out what hasn't gone wrong. I expected a lot more out of this company. My recent order is over 10 days late. (C01151975924) An investigation has been opened and yet I'm still waiting on the outcome of that and it's been two days. Upon realising my parcel was late I spoke to 4 different people to try and sort this out as I needed it in time for a birthday. Yet nothing has been done and I'm still in the same situation. I have been told to wait rather then given any actual solutions. I understand the world is hard at the moment and deliveries take longer over Christmas but I orders it over 2 weeks ago, and it was marked in transit two days after ordering. So it was obvious there was an issue early on but nothing was done.",21 December 2022,GB
Chris,0 stars. Ordered a gift card a week ago and order status is stuck in “preparing”. No way I will get this in time for Christmas now. One very disappointed grandchild on Christmas Day and Nike won’t cancel order nor tell me how long I will have to wait. Won’t be doing that again,14 December 2022,GB
Neil Pattyson,"48 Hour Delivery, cost more but should arrive by Friday 16th December, so easily in time for Xmas.  WRONG!  16 Updates from DPD, my parcel stayed at a Stoke Depot for 6 days, Nike on-line assistant told me to collect from Argos pick up on the 20th December, nothing there, on the 21st December, lied and said they had spoken to DPD on a number I know does not give you access to speak to a human.    To make it more frustrating my wife order a pair of Nike`s for my son from Footlocker, cheap delivery 3 - 6 days, 2 days after me, they arrived today via DPD, you couldn't make it up!!!",21 December 2022,GB
Tron,As we all know when Jordan’s come out it’s first come first serve right. Well I was able to get my son a pair of Jordan’s on Dec. 10th 2022 at 10am when they dropped. Received notice I got them so I paid like I normally do. Money taken right away as usual. It is Dec 21 an no shoes still. I’ve been looking at tracking info since the next day after purchasing. “Waiting for Carrier “ is what it says. So I contact nike via chat. I was told the shoes are stuck an not sure where they’re at. An offered a refund that will take 5-8 business days. It’s 4 days away from Christmas an this is what I’m being told! Really nike? That’s it? If the shoes were for me I would be fine but there for my son. The only thing he asked for. Only thing. All I get told is I’m sorry would you like to start the refund process. Like wow. As many items myself my son my family have purchased from this company an that’s how I’m treated after their mistake. Myself and anyone that I know who orders from here won’t be purchasing anything else!,21 December 2022,US

Haylee,"After reading these reviews, I feel a little bit better about being so bitter about nike. I placed an order for a pair of shoes (12/10) for my boyfriend for his birthday (12/21). They confirmed my order and started ""preparing shipment"". It went on that way for 8 days when the previously expected delivery date would be 12/19. I contacted customer service several times on their chat only to be answered with the same generic answer every time, but they still said my order would arrive by 12/19. On the morning of 12/19 I got an email saying my shipment was delayed. Guess he won't be getting those for his birthday, he'll be lucky to get them before  his next birthday at this point. Just all around nike is a terrible company to deal with and I will not be ordering again.",20 December 2022,US

I used web chat only to be told they can’t re-ship items and they can’t issue a refund until they have investigated (3 - 5 business days) I was told I could collect from a store but the nearest one is 50 miles away and I would have to pay again for the items! It’s 20/12/22 so I doubt I will hear anything before Christmas now……kids won’t have some of there Christmas gifts and I’m over £500 down. Thanks Nike and happy Christmas",20 December 2022,GB
Caroline Norman,"Really bad experience, sent back products and tracking says arrived 8th December. Even though items where tracked refunds for some in the same shipment and not all!!!

Went on live chat today to chase only to be told they currently have no stock and the trainers won't arrive in time for Christmas. They told me there was a pair at a London store but I would have to go there in person, they were not able to arrange delivery. Tried to escalate a complaint only to be told they do not respond to complaints, they just use them as feedback to improve their service?!!!!!! So disappointed!!! Total let down before Christmas. If I had known they had stock issues I would have bought elsewhere, now it's too late.",19 December 2022,GB

Ashley Carnes,If I could customer service a 0 I would. Bought shoes for my husband for Christmas. Got an email that my order was not coming and was being sent back to their warehouse.  I ordered second pair so it would come before Christmas. Well I get the first order and can’t cancel the second because it was more than 30 minutes after the order was placed. I try to call to get Nike to pay for the return because I would never have bought two if it was not for them. The rep said sorry that I didn’t have their membership or could take it to a store which I don’t have the time for that.  What a joke,19 December 2022,US
Jaffa,"Wow, just wow! Ordered a tracksuit for my son for xmas. Was impressed with it arriving so quick only to be bitterly disappointed that what I actually received was a mens tshirt! How hard can it be to pack these items? Clearly someone wasn’t taking any notice when this order was packed. Now have to go out of my way to send it back, with no drop off points close to me and wait god knows how long for a refund. Oh and now my son won’t have his most wanted xmas present. So thanks Nike! I’m going to be out of pocket and have one unhappy son.",19 December 2022,GB
Luka Pavlović,Following-up on a previous review I made. I ordered goods on October 30th from Nike.ca. I received somebody else's order by accident and did not receive ANY of the items I had paid for. Immediately initiated a return process and shipped back the erroneous goods. It has now been over a full month with no advance in my file. Every time I contact Nike.ca support I get a new story about what is going on. Horrible experience and they have held my money hostage for 30+ calendar days. Totally unacceptable. I will now be contesting the charge directly with my credit card provider and bank. Do NOT buy anything online from Nike.ca. This should have been a simple refund but has turned into a nightmare.,30 October 2022,CA
Niall,"NIKE likes to claim they are environmentally conscious but a shipment I recently order travelled from the Netherlands, to Germany, then onto Belgium, then France, then to the USA before finally arriving in Canada.

Jessica Baptiste,Fast shipping and shoes are the right size BUT when the package came in the shoes were all over the place in the big box not the shoe boxes. Should have packed in a smaller box and put paper or something so the shoes didnt come out the shoe boxed when tossed around from ups. These were gifts so kinds embarrassing that they will open the shoe box to a brand new pair of AF1 to see the shoe box paper not looking fresh and neat. Hence the 4star review but other than that it was extremely fast shipping which I’m happy about. Font order from Hibbetts they take for ever and still don’t have a package i ordered on the days as i did with nike.,13 December 2022,US

Verified Customer,"Nike have become lazy and complacent. Their website and apps are in a disgraceful state of repair. They can't even manage real-time stock! This is a 45 billion dollar company people...They also fuel the black market by doing limited runs. Now most ""Nike"" products, especially ""Jordan"" are reproductions and the market is flooded with scammers and fake items. Nike encourages this through their anti-human business policies. This is no longer the famous brand it was, it is just a money vacuum now. Avoid!",16 December 2022,GB
matthew,"Nike has fallen a very long way indeed. From global sporting brand super power to literally one of the worst brands/retailers. The UK warehouse clearly cannot cope with the orders it is receiving. Placed a first order for 2 pairs of leggings waited 5 days..no dispatch email, no tracking... Live chat reported that the order had been 'lost'... Immediately 'dispatched' a second order...Guess what? 11 days later.. No sign of the order, back to live chat, turns out that the order hadn't been shipped at all... Asking for a full refund to be told that ""Normally I have to make you wait 10 days after the estimated delivery due date which is December 12th...""  which was 4 DAYS AGO.....  SO can't give a refund because i should wait another 6 days...I ask for a tracking number... ah yes.. It hasn't actually been shipped!!  SO in essence me, the customer, has to wait, in total 17 days before i can get a refund for an order that Nike never shipped in the first place?!!  Wow... AVOID AT ALL COSTS",16 December 2022,GB
Carly,"I have to say that I am totally disappointed for such a large reputable company to have such a poor customer service system, I ordered products in the black Friday sales total should have been £301 but with the discounts it came to £179,this parcel went missing and being Christmas presents for my niece and daughter I was keen to re-order the items, Unfortunately the only thing Nike could offer was to refund me ( this would take up to 9 days to reach my account), I could then replace my order with a 20% discount code and hope everything turned up on time. the issue with this gesture for me is that, I don't have £240 (£60 more than my original order) spare this time of year to place the order that has been lost and also its not actually a good will gesture when I have to spend more money before my refund arrives and also risk not getting presents on time anyway. this to me was about as much use as a chocolate teapot! all i wanted was for them to process the order again from their end with the correct discount applied and free next day shipping, which should be easy for a company of their size and status........",14 December 2022,GB

Rob,"Shocking service! I placed an order on 30/11 to be shipped by 08/12. I checked my order progress on 14/12 and it was still in progress. I used the chat service to chase to then be told my order was cancelled on 01/12 for which i received no notification. I paid using a mix of gift card and credit card. the 1st advisor informed be it was bank issue and to contact my bank. The next advisor said it was an issue with my gift cards. They have no clue! I've now reordered using the same payment methods. The options i have is to escalate a complaint which could take 7 days or let the advisor monitor the order for 48 hours to see if it processes. If it doesn't progress, it will get escalated and guess what, it'll be upto 9 days then. Nike are happy to cash gift cards without notifying customers that orders have been cancelled. It feels like theft to me! Beware when dealing with this global brand!",15 December 2022,GB

When asked to speak to a manager I’m being told they don’t have a complaints department, I’ll just have to wait, I have no faith or trust this refund is arriving, I’m waiting to purchase a tracksuit for my son for Christmas which will never arrive in time, I’m offering solutions and having no support at all with this.

Heather,"This evening, my family and I visited the Nike Employee Store and I experienced poor treatment due to my disability. On crutches and wearing a boot on my right foot, I was told I would not be able to sit down inside the store because I would get ""in the way"". After searching for several minutes, an employee found a chair and told me I could sit in a hallway used as a fire exit. But, since I'd be blocking the exit, I'd have to leave if requested. Due to this unacceptable treatment, my family and I chose to leave the store. I've been unable to contact management, the store's phone will not pick up or accept messages. I chatted with a representative at Nike.com and they could not provide me any contact information for store management.I believe it's important for disabled members of our society to know that Nike had embraced ableist policies and is not willing to make accommodations at their employee store.",11 December 2022,US

Have been waiting for over 2 weeks for a refund on a product i never received due to the item not being in stock requested a refund on the 29th November and was told I’d receive a confirmation email for the refund within 24 hours never did… went back on live chat was asked the same questions again and was told they would process the refund even though I already thought it had been done… was told to wait another 5-9 working days to receive this still never did. Went back on the live chat  and was assured that I would receive the refund by today (2 weeks later) STILL NOTHING. have gone back onto the chat to speak to someone today and was told again that they would process the refund absolutely shocking customer service after trying to explain my frustration to this person on the live chat they just ended it… shocking when your job is meant is focused on ‘customer experience’ Called up and spoke to a nice representative called Kalin who sincerely apologised for this and could see that none of the times I requested a refund was it actually processed. He assured me I would receive the refund confirmation by tomorrow and the actual refund within another 5-9 working days… I would NEVER purchase from the Nike store again.,13 December 2022,GB

AA,"Nike is a huge company making so much money but when it comes to getting a refund. They are a nightmare. Tracking clear shows they have received it but their customer service tells you to wait up to 2 weeks before they can even initiate refund process. None of the other companies take this long. Some companies even initiate the refund on the spot as a goodwill gesture. Definitely not buying from Nike again and going to other companies that never have this problem.Update two (15/12/22):They told me to wait till today to reach out. After telling them the tracking numbers that are generated on the order page. They still required photos of the post office receipts. Surely they can just input the tracking numbers onto Royal Mail webpage to check?After contacting them again with the photos, they have now sent the photos of the same tracking numbers to a senior team for processing. They asked for another 3-5 working days which means at this rate, it takes at least 1 whole month since sending it back to receive refund. This is assuming there's no issues. Nike has the worst customer service I have experienced out of all the many places I have shopped. I would definitely recommend Adidas or Reebok in the future, they make great shoes and customer service is so much better.",12 December 2022,GB
Christopher Gibson,"Read the bad reviews , just because they are nike don't mean they handle situations responsibly. Ordered £145 trainers , said it was delayed 7 days after ordered , then to be told 10 days for refund , 15 days later still waiting from start of order till today I've waited 22 days. Ordered clothes , sent back tracked order via royal mail they recieved the items back 2 weeks ago , so 14 days later and yet again still no refunds for either order. I'll never use Nike online again customer service is disgusting.",22 November 2022,GB

RebeccaM,"Utterly appalling customer service, having followed up on an email on  9th December 2022 stating that my order had been ""cancelled or returned."" This was a very much sought after Christmas present for my son. Nike Customer Services could not offer a reasonable explanation as to why it had cancelled,  despite that I had email confirmation with a tracking number and inform of dispatch. I was then advised later that day of the following - ""Hello! I think we got disconnected. I discussed the matter with my supervisor and it is possible that the automatic refund was triggered because the item was shortly unavailable for dispatch. However, this money will be back in your account within 9 working days. I am very sorry for this situation, it does not usually happen.""The following day on 10th December 2022, I recieved a further email - ""Thanks for your order. Your payment overview is attached.* (If we send more than one package, you might see more than one payment overview notice.) You can track your package here. We’ll get your shipment to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, feel free to contact us with any questions.Nike.com"" Confusing to say the least, does this mean I can still expect the package? No......The link does not allow to 'track your package', only showed the order remains 'returned.' No idea if I am to actually expect the package now or whether I will recieve refund in a timely manner. I have lost confidence in Nike and will not be purchasing from them again. I would advise anyone considering purchase for Christmas, as it is doubtful you will recieve item or your money back in time to remedy their error. I would like to draw your attention to another review also dated 9th December 2022, which they appear to highlight a similar issue.⚠️71% ONE star reviews! (Shocker!) AVOID at all costs!⚠️",09 December 2022,GB
Adria Davis,"My order never arrived, I chased it up and eventually found out it had been lost in transit. Nike said they would cancel the order (which I would presume also means processing a refund for it) and I would need to place the order again. They gave me a discount code for the inconvenience which I was going to use, and at that point I would’ve been a happy customer. However, since then Nike haven’t let Klarna know that they cancelled my order so now Klarna think I owe them £400. The order was placed on 29th Oct. We’re in mid December now. I’ve contacted Klarna, they tell me to speak to Nike. Nike have been ignoring my emails dated 15 Nov and 04 Dec. I’ve rang the Nike customer service line twice and both times I have been unable to hear what the service agent is saying, either because of the fuzzy line, the level of English language or a combination of the two. I’m sorry to bring this up but it’s a problem as it’s caused even more frustration at this situation and it’s the only mode of communication you offer on your website. I can’t believe how appalling the communication has been. As a principle I won’t be buying Nike products anymore.",11 December 2022,GB

Got a coat on Black Friday deal, when it came to delivery it never got attempted and was sent back to nike. I asked nike if they could redirect it and told me loads of different reasons on why they couldn’t, one example was that my parcel was lost and then on another example they couldn’t send it back because of there ‘system’. For such a big company you think they could work round there system or simply just change it. So much hassle, customer service is absolutely terrible! Appalling!!!!!",09 December 2022,GB

I was aghast, so rude and unhelpful, they owe me money and they say it’s in there terms and conditions, and I can’t find it anywhere and the advisor was going to send me the link and cut me off, so started a chat with another unhelpful person and demanded a call back from a manager.

Their FAQs stated they have a choice of printable returns slips or QR codes with no printer needed.This is a lie. They will simply send you a standard returns label which needs a printer and make up so random lie as to what part is the QR code. When you go online or to the post office you can CLEARLY SEE this is NOT a QR code yet their monkeys with keyboards at Nike will keep repeating that it is a QR code no matter what evidence you provide them to the contrary.I am lucky I paid these thieves through PayPal so I will get PayPal to refund me and throw the ripped junk ""Nike"" sent me in the bin...",08 December 2022,GB

customer,"Awful! Worst customer service experience ever. Shoes were apparently delivered to store. I had the email stating shoes will be there for 10 days. I go on fourth day, and really out of my way to get them too. Owner says shoes have been returned to Nike upon UPS request. Says UPS doesn't let the shops keep for more than two days (??). Says I have to call UPS. Gives me UPS number. My kid now doesn't have his trainers for his birthday the next day. Kid in tears. Spend ages on phone to UPS. They eventually tell me shop owner refused to even accept the delivery in the first place. Going round in circles and plenty confusion. I call Nike: 1. Why wasn't I notified that shoes aren't there? 2. Why aren't they there? 3. Kid's birthday ruined 4. I have to now spend more the next day trying to make it up to him 5. Have now spent hours of time I don't have driving around and calling trying to resolve. Nike rep says he'll get everything sorted out and agrees I should be compensated. So maybe I will return to Nike after this. 5 days go by....no word, no email, no call...I email. No reply. I email again...and again....and again..... Finally today call again, have to go through the whole thing yet again. Very sweet rep can't apologise enough, refunds immediately and compensates 20% off next purchase. Obviously there's nothing she can personally do about that, but the compensation is offensive and I will definitely not ever be buying for me or my family ever again.

I can provide them with a tracking code for proof that thhey are in transit, but I still need to buy the other size again? Net profits of $21.5bn and I need to buy the shoes again because their system doeesn't function properly? They cannot tell me why the order was cancelled and wont place me a new order.

After requesting an investigation that took a further month I requested a refund.It has now been 5 months, many phone calls, no shoes, and NO REFUND, I am beyond frustrated. I’ve been advised that Nike has refunded me to a PayPal account in CAD dollars. Firstly I paid with my NZ credit card in NZD. I do not have a PayPal account and I have not received any refund in any of my accounts.We are now disputing this refunded - all over two pairs of shoes purchased 5 months ago costing me $238.94 NZD ouch!

Danielle Cheyenne,I’m so dissatisfied with Nike the company as a whole is horrible I know it’s not the employees fault or the customer service representatives but every time I make a purchase if I have to do it in exchange for whatever reason usually sizing or quality they seem to never get my order right or actually send me my return they just give you your money back and then tell you that they’re out of stock they never know when they’re going to be in stock so you can’t ever get what you want and then whenever you call and speak about it they have no recollection of verification you ever called it’s like it’s nonexistent I just feel like I was working with a narcissist like they gaslighted me the whole entire time every time,06 December 2022,US

Taisha,If I was able to give the rating a zero I would with no problem. I have ordered a pair of Jorden Rings 6 Atmosphere/ Black/White/Infrared 23 toddler for my niece size 6 C the condition of the shoes I have to say they were in horrible condition the white part of the shoes had black marks on one shoes than the other shoes was even finish I was able to see dry glue at the corners of the head of the shoes. I’m very disappointed in the condition my shoes came in. I even spoke to customer services and blame the shipping process which made no sense because my box was even destroyed its very unacceptable and inconvenient that I have to return these shoes due to inaccurate inspection on Nike end which this wasn’t done correctly seem like they don’t really care about there products at all if they able to send out shoes unfinished but marks on the shoes . I’ll be returning these and going else where I recommend kids foot locker. I wouldn’t recommend shopping online with Nike thats if you want incomplete product either do a pick order so your able to return that item. I hope no customer has to experience the condition my shoes were in. It just shows that it doesn’t matter to them if they lose out on one customer sense they profit no matter what so differences it makes.

Customer,Shocking customer service. My sons training are lost and as the customer I am stuck in the middle between Nike and DPD and neither will resolve the issue until the other has taken action. Basically neither will take responsibility for their actions!! Every time I speak to Nike I have to wait another 24hrs! Currently I have to wait another 24hrs for a manager who may or may not decide to call me back!!!! Best solution they can offer me currently is a refund for the shoes that were on offer and I have to re order the trainers at full price. Whilst waiting 5 days for the funds to be returned to me.

Sasuke,"An utterly, utterly useless 'store'.Won't accept payment, with debit card, credit card, paypal, or anything else. Just hangs and gives you a 'sorry this is taking a while, don't refresh' type message... that hangs there for -- literally -- HOURS until you give up and refresh. And try again. And again. And again. Until the store eventually blocks you trying.You literally canot buy anything from this 'store'. I can only assume the entire thing is a fake. No actual products. Or they are sitting around on mountains of boxes wondering why no-one orders anything.I even called them and their -- useless, of course -- suggestion was to 'try paypal' (nope, doesn't work). Hopeless.An annoying, expensive (in terms of my time -- for which I am normally paid) waste of time. Avoid Nike or use their physical stores.[EDIT: Eventually, an HOUR after starting the payment process, I managed to get it to work on another browser. Still an epic technical mess by Nike and will forever avoid starting a purchase with them to avoid it. Sort it out NIke!]",02 December 2022,GB

Clearly no quality control, and when I ring Nike they basically don’t care and just say send them back. That’s great apart from the fact that if I do that I now can’t deliver on my daughters Xmas present. It’s not hard to make sure your products are fit for sale and meet quality standards.

anonymous,"I'm from The Netherlands and ordered shoes from nike.com and also did a return.Delivery was fast, ordered on saturday and arrived on monday. The shoes were too small, so I called them by phone (yes they actually have real humans to answer the phone) and we arranged to get me the right size. The person on the phone could see the current stocks which was also helpful. They emailed me a return label to return the shoes that were too small, used the box in which they came and brought it to the post office, and 3 days later I already had my money back on my bank account.To be honest I tried the shoes out a bit, but they said it was not a problem. I also expected the refund process to take some time, but when the refund was transferred almost immediately, I decided to write a short review here to express my appreciation.Would definitely buy again and there are no worries returning and getting your money back.

john allen,"Nikes guarantee a waste of space. I'm 68 Yr old. Have bought Nikes for decades now, but my £135 trainers developed a hole in both soles within 10 months and that's just with minimal use. Never experienced this before. Returned them for Nike to 'inspect' and for a reduced refund of £30 (I didn't have receipt, which may have meant a full refund) . THEY HAD THE CHEEK TO REFUSE BY SAYING 'WEAR AND TEAR',even though the rest of the trainers were like new. Well that's it for me now... From now on it will be Adidas, or whoever for a more realistic price of £30-40. Just go to Sports Direct. NIKE can now take a running jump",18 November 2022,GB
Amw04,"Have purchased custom trainers from the Nike website in the past, and was really happy with them and the service provided. I have tried logging in to do the same again, but I am being told I do not have an account, which is confusing. I re-registered and spent a while designing my custom trainers. However I have been trying to add these trainers into the basket to purchase for 3 days now with no joy whatsoever. I even tried adding a random item into the basket just to see if there was an issue just with the custom items but still not successful. I have messaged Nike but not yet had a response. Unfortunately I have decided to purchase from a different brand.",27 November 2022,GB

Paul Cinnamon,"The Nike product is always of high quality - wanted the Spurs 3rd shirt for our grandson, out of stock at Spurs, and in fact better value online with name/premier badge. What gets me, is I do not want to participate in (presumably) airfreight of single items from mainline Europe - I buy from a UK website, expect delivery from the UK. Also leads to multiple tracking delivery dates as the item passes through customs. So -1 star for delivery from abroad, and -3 stars for for three different delivery days!",24 November 2022,GB

The process of getting shipping label and initiate the return was very bad, no information reference number. After sending I didn't get any updat from nike, even I could see the package was received by them i will get gift card if they see it as defect (3-4 weeks processing time).2. After they couldn't find my shoe, and made me super nervous about their bad overview of the whole process. 3. After that they wanted me to send proff that I have sent it. 4. At this point it's 12 weeks after and they confirm that I will get gift now. And says it will take additional 4-5 weeks. Someone from nike please get this sorted. I am still waiting",10 August 2022,DK

L B,"If anyone else here ever tried entering the raffle on SNKRS for limited editions, you would understand how awfully difficult it is. And to win it? It felt like winning the lottery. But how about this, couple hours later I got an email that the order (after winning that nearly impossible to enter raffle) is cancelled because it is out of stock?When I contacted the customer service, the reply was the stock was out when my order entered, meaning Nike already sold the stock to elsewhere before the winners of the draw can even get to it? Shouldn’t a predetermined amount of stock be allocated for this raffle prior to the draw? It just blows my mind how there is a draw of which the prize is not even available from start?",19 November 2022,CA
Natalija Snapkauskaite,"I ordered a pair of shoes with Nike.com and the experience has been really 'meh'.1. The order tracking was unreliable: information on the order page was not updated, the email notification ""order shipped"" was sent after the order was delivered, and I did not receive ""delivered order"" notification in time to ensure I could pick up the package so it wouldn't be stolen.2. The support team was not able to provide more details on the order than the non-fuctional order page; I would not blame this on a support specialist as I think they might not have the needed information. However, overall it was a disappointing experience.3. Support chat is bugged: I was in the middle of the chat with a customer support specialist; they told me something like ""please wait a minute, I'll get back to you"" and the chat was closed due to me being inactive.4. Shipping is very slow - I was expected much speedier delivery from Nike; in the future, I'd prefer to order from a reseller instead or choose another brand.",07 November 2022,CA
customer,I ordered a LA Lakers top for my daughter. She liked the big black zip feature and the top which arrived did not have the thick black zip across the jumper. We complained and said the item was no longer in stock and were offered a 10% discount off a future item. We asked to speak to a manager as wanted a discount off this order not a future order as the error was with Nike. The customer advisor James then ended the chat. Awful service.

Having called up about the situation I was then emailed and told I was wrong and the package had been delivered. I then emailed back explaining the package did arrive but 1 item was missing. I was then told that the warehouse team had confirmed the item wasn’t missing and that the weight of the parcel was correct (even though only a T-shirt minimal weight was missing). I have asked for prood if this and had no reply yet. I was told to contact law enforcement for the missing T-shirt even though the package was sealed. What a joke,19 November 2022,GB

The items in total cost me £364 which was taken from my accounts immediately after placing the order. I received my order number and then after an hour so saw that the order information page was reading as “preparing shipment” this all seemed well and good until I checked the next day and it still said “preparing shipment.” Okay, I thought, one or two days to pick the items and wrap them up ready for shipping isn’t too bad, I can deal with that, so I check back the next day and the next and the next, each day saying the same thing thing. The order was expected to arrive on the 11th. When I tried to contact Nike about it through the useless online chat service I received no help whatsoever, they palmed me off saying that they can’t do anything as they don’t know anything about anything at all and it’s their policy to make me wait 3-5 days for any information with regards to my order status.

After being hung up on 3 times immediately after holding, I get someone who is actually willing to help (75% failure rating) then I had to go thru and reorder everything, apply the discount they gave me for being terrible, and I paid thru a different method (Apple Pay) the second time. Next day, same thing cancelled it again. Keep in mind they’re KEEPING A HOLD ON MY CARD the whole time. So they have almost $1000 of my money, and see no problems keeping it for 10 days, when ZERO services were rendered. It’s basically robbery. They offer nothing as far as reconciliation.

I received one of the 3 items I ordered and then a second parcel containing only a baby grow (18m-24m) when my youngest child is 10! I sent the wrong item back after contacting nike via live chat to explain I haven’t received two items and sent proof of postage as requested. 3 months later and 7 different live chats and phone calls I’ve not received my items or my money back. Customer Service is the worst I’ve ever experienced. Every time I’ve asked what’s going on they keep fobbing me off until I think they believe will just give up complaining. I’m owed two expensive items and I’d like to know what has gone wrong. Yet it’s nigh on impossible to formally complain. Their products might be good but their rubbish service and lack of respect for their paying customers should put you off. Do not order from nike.,04 November 2022,GB

They want to see the bad shoes in person, wants to mail that $200 shoe back to the store where I pay the shipping and recommended insurance so they can inspect it and make there decision about it!! Seriously Nike!! I trusted ur product, did not have a problem paying for it that hard earned $200 and u do not trust a picture from a damaged product to be emailed to you!! The Rebacca that I guys hired at the customer service to be the manager clearly said it is the costumers’ problem they trusted Nike they said.

Never able to get! Today, I did the same, set my alarm, got in the queue early, got the trainers in my basket, only to be told my card is invalid! This is the same message I get every time at the launch event. Obviously a system error, as my card is good enough for the rest of the year! I contact customer services who tell me they’ll feed this back. I fed this back the last couple of times and I’m still in the same position.

I enter the store, provide my delivery details, NO ITEM IN STORE! P***ed but no panic! Later I contacted Nike Customer Services and I'm told ""They'll be there tomorrow!"" It's not acceptable, but hey I tried to be patient. I checked the delivery status (which wasn't available yesterday), and the F**king shoes are STILL IN BRUSSELS! Are you kidding me!! For the last twenty years (or so), I have sadly watched the demised of this once great brand, and it's really sad! From the poor size restructuring of the clothes (where joggers are coming up short), to the poor staff product knowledge, care and empathy. Clearly not the Nike, that I used to spend ALL my money on in the 90's. That Nike had a feel-good factor about it. This what's here now, is a Horror show!

Vicki Haslam,"I purchased a pair of vapourmax that I have only worn 5/6 times, they still look brand new they have had such little wear. The bubble in both heels has deflated, leaving the shoes unwearable. It falls just outside of the 2 year warranty period.

Eric,"Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. I send in my vapormax under warranty less than a year. I was to get a refund for the sneakers is what their email said in 7-10 days. They tried to refund my money but could not. Never contacted me about the issue this is almost a month later I remembered, checked my account and nothing. Get in contact with them and all they offer me is a nike gift card in the amount I paid, will not replace the item under warranty. Item cost more now so they will not replace it. Elite nike team are rude and not professional at all.",13 October 2022,US
Na,Awful costumer services. I was scammed by Nike. I ordered a pair of football boots and a socks and I only received the socks.

Karen Mccarthy,"Ordered 2 items from nike online for delivery on the 3rd of Oct 2022 ,received one of my items with the other to follow , on the 12th of October I received a message from the delivery company that my parcel was ready to pick up from a premier store in blackpool , I rang nike cs to be reassured that the lady I spoke to had arranged for the parcel to be delivered to my home , then today I received a further message today 17th of oct saying today is the last chance to pick up my parcel from the premier store named last week , so obviously I rang again , the cs operator stated that I would have to receive a refund as I can't get the parcel redelivered , he said they had tried to deliver the parcel but couldn't for whatever reason , I had already told them in the previous phone call that I am disabled and housebound and could not get to the store or anywhere else for that matter and I live 50 miles away from my family, I was also offered 15% discount for the inconvenience , which I turned down , after the call I remembered that I'd had a delivery last week and when I went to the door the delivery driver had two parcels , after giving me a parcel he knocked on my neighbours door at which point I came back into my home and thought nothing of it ,I didn't open the parcel until the next day as it was a Christmas present ,So there was no rush , when I did open it , it turned out to be chocolates,on checking the name and address it was my neighbours parcel ,immediately I realised the driver got the parcels mixed up, on speaking to my neighbour I found out she didn't know anything about a delivery as she was at work, what I didn't expect was that I wouldn't get my parcel at all , Why would I accept a 15% discount off the nike online store when I can't get what I ordered to begin with , first and last time I use nike online",17 October 2022,GB

Dawn Collie,"Had to return faulty trainers and reorder a replacement pair as they are ‘unable to exchange goods purchased online’. Weird but ok. Returned faulty pair mid September and receipt of faulty trainers confirmed. However, I’m STILL waiting for a refund. Bearing in mind I had to reorder and pay again for replacement trainers, Nike has taken payment for the second pair immediately but is unable, or unwilling, to process a refund for the faulty shoes. The customer service experience has been shocking when trying to confirm when I should expect a refund; every rep has been very vague and unhelpful in repeating the same mantra of ‘your refund is waiting to be processed’. Seriously, why is it taking so long when you’ve had the returned goods for a month now? It should not be as difficult and time consuming to get my money back for goods bought in good faith that have not been fit for purpose. I’ll be avoiding Nike in future and I suggest others do the same.",17 September 2022,GB

Trevor Donkin,Shocking ordered a pair of trainers for birthday present and they did not arrive. They use EVRI as a courier? I got notification saying they have them and will be delivered as contracted. Following day I got notification saying there’s been a delay and they will try and ensure they are delivered next working day. 6 days nothing???? I contacted Nike and was advised they have 2 days to get delivery too me. I’ve contacted them again today and they have offered a refund or replacement? Ok I’ll take replacement if it’s not Evri? sorry we can’t guarantee it won’t be the same courier? Ok just refund. So moral of story is Nike has had my money now for 10 days. This was a birthday present which did not arrive on time. They offered a replacement but I requested a different courier. They could not offer this? My guess is they have went for the shitest cheapest courier EVRI and they really couldn’t give a Flying F@@K about there customers. My cost my loss no mention of a exgratia payment??? Nice customer services NIKE ???,14 October 2022,GB

Marcos Rivera,"My experience as a Nike Member has been nothing short of horrific. My package was stolen by the shippers. I just spoke with a customer service rep yes I was refunded but of course Air Jordan 4 Retro these are limited sneakers the are not in stock. I'm extremely disappointed in Nike for deciding to do business with a corrupt and disgusting company . I checked the tracking, and it says the shoes are in transit. The estimated delivery date was 10/12/2022, however they have been at the Secaucus, NJ Laser ship Facility since 1012/2022 1:00 AM, and it currently 9:00 AM 10/14/2022 Nike is associating itself with a company who's been reported for damaging and stealing the personal property of recipients. The company has been penalized by multiple governments for misclassifying drivers as independent contractors, and for delivering untaxed cigarettes (for which the company was prosecuted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

catriona bannon,"Absolutely horrendous experience trying to order track suit on Nike.com. It seems, after Googling what’s wrong with Nike ordering, there is a glitch in their system for ordering anymore than 1item. They’ve set this up to limit the online traders who purchase large quantities of a limited edition for resale at huge mark up. The ‘glitch’ is a typical customer can’t order a few items as an Error code comes up & they tell you it’s a busy time or it’s your payment method - one lie after another!Will not be purchasing from them again -a new customer for North Face!",14 October 2022,GB
Richard Bridge,"I ordered 7 packs of these sock and received only 5. The package arrived with no visible breaks or damage (which would suggest there was no issue with the package in transit). After immediately contacting Nike support I was told that due to the ""weight"" of the package being ""correct"" when it was shipped, they would not be correcting the issue. A further two times contacting them, the two very helpful representatives unfortunately could not help as the warehouse supervisor (from where this was shipped) point blank refused that there was any issue and would no longer pursue the case. This is a total shame as this product is very good. I no longer have any confidence in Nike and would warn future purchasers to video the unpacking process to ensure quantities are correct. If a parcel arrives at your door and has no tampering, you would assume there was an error (which can happen) in packing. I have now unfortunately paid £20.00+ for two items I will never receive.",03 October 2022,GB

I kept tracking the order and it was stuck on ""Processing Shipment"" for weeks. Finally, on the 12th I realised this order is never going to change status, then I called them and I was told that they made a mistake by selling me a shoe that is out of stock and I should now wait for a refund that will only appear in my bank account after 10 working days (meaning I will only get it after the 22nd). Mind you, the shoes were supposed to be a birthday gift for my wife who is born on the 12th. If I had never followed up, they were never going to call me.

So I called up this morning and was told I had to re-order for a third time which means it would of taken 3 weeks to get a gift card, probably the worse customer service experience I have ever had in my life, I recommend not using Nike.com, instead use sports direct or something.",11 October 2022,GB

Waited over a month, then emailed saying where's the refund. At this point they asked me to email proof of postage - which I did. Waited another couple of weeks and now they are saying, we got the parcel but there was nothing in it, so we're not refunding you. Asked to speak with a manager and NO-ONE would call me back. They've now re-escalated the case to investigate the warehouse and said I'd get a call in another week with a decision!!!! I just don't get it!! No other retailer behaves this way.

They are saying that they do not know anything about what is happening with the card and they keep “escalating” the case but nothing is happening.

Oliver George,"Absolutely appalling customer service.  Used online chat initially to query an outstanding order only for my chat session to time out as I had to wait for a response from the agent.  Surely it should only time out if they are waiting for me to reply, otherwise the agents can just sit back and let every query expire?  Tried the helpline only to give up after half an hour.  Tried chat again and spoke to an Ericka who offered to cancel my order as the item was out of stock, even though the website still shows them as in stock but now 10gbp more than what I ordered them at.  I did highlight this to the agent who totally blanked this and said she can only authorise cancellation of the order.  So I asked for details on how to lodge a formal complaint and requested my order be fulfilled and they just hung up on me and ended the chat. Out of interest, I went back immediately to the item and ordered at the higher price and magically its gone straight through and will be delivered in a few days.  What an absolute crock of excrement.  This is not the first time this has happened to me and the Nike customer services team couldn't give two hoots about my complaints.  They must be on commission for closed out requests or something.  I advise people to steer clear of the website and order though someone like Footlocker of FootPatrol.

Dominic M,"The Brooklyn 11 hoody and Airforce 1s bought for my teenager arrived today. He is still at school, so ofc I try on the hoody. I decide I want it. But I can't have it because it's his. I'm going to order another one right now. I'm joking. That'll have to wait until next week.Let me explain: The Brooklyn 11 hoody has a very distinctive cut around the neckline. It extenuates the shoulders neck and arms. It has enough body and shape that you can pair it with both tight and loose-fitting jeans. It's dope and I'm confident Kanye West would approve.I made a point to provide a review here because I read these reviews the day after my purchase, and on the strength of the dismal ratings fretted that I'd made a big mistake. I'm here to set the record straight. The parcel arrived on cue (14 days as promised). It may have arrived sooner if it hadn't got held up at NZ customs for a week! But two weeks from Europe or USA, for a clothing parcel? that's good. They provide an ETA based on your location so if you can't bear the thought of waiting 2-3 weeks then don't buy it. They give you a thirty-minute window from POS to cancel for full refund. Not bad!The customer service ""chat"" option is fast and efficient. They give you clear instructions on returns (which are free btw).",30 September 2022,NZ
Anita Parisi,Nike has gone downhill in the past few years. The quality of the clothing is extremely bad after a few washes. Trackpants I purchased a few weeks ago falling apart pulling threads out each time I wear them. Black clothing especially jumpers already look faded & fade more after only a few washes. They are buying cheap material & charging for it. I won’t be buying any more clothing. Fare enough before the clothes were worth it. Was happy to pay $100 for a new season jumper. But now I look like I wear old clothes just washing items a few times.it’s really disappointing because we have spent thousands over the years. Shoes are good don’t ever have issues with shoes. But won’t be long before they start buying cheaper materials. I see them putting profit before customer satisfaction,30 September 2022,AU

Then that essentially that they were not damaged enough, even though I sent pictures beforehand.Now that it is the wrong item. Please can I get a picture of these supposed other trainers I sent. This has become ridiculous! Please can my case be dealt with by senior management today. James did not even address the rude service I had with the agent who hung up the phone!

Contacted customer service, they messed me about asking me to take photos and answer loads of questions to then tell me I had to go to store - what was the point in all of the questions and photos then?!In store, they told me it was online customer service who needed to help, so completely the opposite of what the online team said. They told me the online team would send me packaging to return the item (this turned out later to not be the case!)Eventually they said I could return the product as it was defective. I asked them to send me packaging and a returns label code to print in store as I don't have a printer. They said they don't supply packaging to return (opposite of what the in-store team said) and that I had to print the label - I told them I don't have a printer and they offered no solution. When I told them that I had paid tube fair to go to store and that I would have to pay for packaging to return they didn't care despite this all being their fault - they did offer a 10% off voucher for my next order (as if I would be ordering again after all of this!). When I told the customer service agent on the phone that the person on the online chat originally told me to go to store, she claimed this didn't happen so I asked her to send me the chat history but she wouldn't (isn't this my personal data which I am entitled to see under GDPR regulation?!).

Richard,Nike service is like a raffle: sometimes it perfect and sometimes terrible bad. Nike does not even know that they have not shipped my order and keep my money till I start to ask questions. I asked in a chat what happend with my 2 week old order and support say it is lost. I got accidentally interrupted in a chat and asked the same question from a different support person and this time the package was in preparation. Happens with my orders many times and usually Nike does not make the effort just push you away with a coupon. I have literally 300+ Nike items in my wear rotation and I can tell it is hard work to order and even harder to receive the order. I would rate as average but before this order I received a raffle 200 EUR retro in a ruined sneaker box. If I would send it back no replacement is available…what can I do right?,16 September 2022,SK

Kelly,Managed to get a pair of Jordans on their release date for my 12 year old daughter. Order never arrived. DPD said Nike did not send them the parcel. Contacted customer service via live chat who said sorry must be lost in transit. Nothing can be done apart from refund. They had my money for 12 days. It took me contacting them to find out what was going on. Asked numerous times to escalate the issue to find out where the item is or source a replacement to which was denied.Apparently looks like you can only speak to first line support at Nike and have to accept whatever response they give you. No second line support no exec support team. Checked my account and they have marked them as refunded as they were returned. Complete lies. Do not even believe they had them in stock in the first place.  Massively annoyed as now have to explain to my daughter shoes will now not arrive.,14 September 2022,GB

Avoid Nike.com.  horrible customer service.,13 September 2022,US
Joseph S.,"Nike has a great app, and excellent product but their service after the sale is stuck in the 1990s.Filing for a return and exchange is relatively simple. But they have to receive your return and check your return and then “prepare“ your return before it they will send it. I’ve been waiting on my replacement for three weeks. According to the website they were in stock the day I filed for my return/exchange. This just seems like a bad policy.For example, other online retailers will ship you a replacement item immediately, and give you a window of time to have returned the original item before they charge you for the second item.Example:I had actually ordered the wrong size of baseball pants for my son, Set up a return exchange and had the new pants three days later.  I think most people this day and age would relate to that sort of return exchange policy with the vast majority of online retailers.Why can’t Nike do the same?",12 September 2022,US

Yogi Jones,"I received an email that offered a summer20 discount on top of 16% off on my favorite shoes. Sounds great right? Nope, the site nor the app would allow me to make the purchase. So I called customer service and they would not allow me to make the purchase with the discounts sent to me via email.  They said that offer was for employees only. What the heck!!! I asked, why did you send me the offer then? Their response was, “it was a mistake. You can purchase them at the regular price and if they go on sale we will give you a refund”. Love the shoes, hate the service!!!! I’m taking a long break from Nike!",01 September 2022,US
Andrew Farmer,"I order a pair of Nike Pegasus trainers 38 from Nike website. I was told they would arrive at my house between 12:30/1:30pm by DPD & Nike. I took this time off from work intending to go back to work once my order arrived. 12:30,1:30,2:30 came and went and no delivery. 3pm and lady driver from DPD Parked outside my house got out the van poked around in the back got back into her drivers seat and drove off without delivering my trainers. Several messages later to Nike and my order arrived 8 hours later at 9:45pm. I asked Nike for compensation of loss of earnings £70 after loading an afternoon at work and all Nike offered me was a 20% discount off my next purchase 😡20% off my next purchase.This will not pay my house hold bills. Yours most disappointed Andrew Farmer",09 September 2022,GB

Lucy,"I buy shoes, clothes for my boys from Nike for years.I recently ordered black school trainers for my son, they didn't arrive on the day they should, I contacted customer service chat and I was informed they are out of stock. I cancelled the order as I needed to buy shoes somewhere else. A few days later I received an email that the shoes were dispatched. I contacted customer service again and I was told I will receive a refund within 5 days.

T,"For starters it would be amazing if trustpilot can have no stars or a poop emoji to rate companies like these. Ordered a pair of trainers as a gift and it never arrived. I called the customer care number in UK to see if I could rearrange the delivery and they only know how to say sorry. Offered me a promo code, I will probably ask them to shove it where the sun don't shine. They were meant to come on Wednesday to my door step, instead left it in a pick up location miles away. When asked the representatives they say they can't do much from their end. Might as well pack up and look for opportunities for packing eggs. This is why we shouldn't be brand loyal that's how this companies are taking the mick. I don't know if trading standards can look into all this. Celebrities who are supporting this good for nothing companies should be ashamed of themselves. Sad to say this though, I wish one day Nike would go bankrupt. I am absolutely annoyed with the quality of their service. I don't think anyone from Nike actually read these reviews on trustpilot which says a lot. Stay away from this cockroaches.",07 September 2022,GB

Nad Kassam,Order 2 pairs of trainers and they got lost in transit. Nike only notified me of this after I contacted them and offered me only a 10% promo code for the inconvenience. Definitely won't be ordering directly from them again. Poor service.,08 September 2022,GB
Kay,Honestly the worst experience I have had with any retailer in my life. If I was able to give zero stars I truly would. I made an order on the 28th of August and the estimated delivery was the 1st of September I am still awaiting my order to be delivered it is now the 7th of September. I questioned why my parcel has taken so long And they said some of the items were out of stock which I don’t understand why you would let somebody buy an item knowing it is out of stock. I have to be inconvenienced and all they can do is apologise but still give me no accurate update on when my parcel will be delivered it is now a week plus and there has been nothing.I am so traumatised by this experience with Nike I will never be purchasing from the website again and I will pass the word around too! so much money has been spent and no parcel,07 September 2022,GB
Ksenia K,"Very poor service. As soon. They start using Herme/Evri my 3 parcels  been lost. Before they been using DPD I never had any problems. Customer service is very useless too.

Ruth Gleeson Monahan,"Zero stars! I am having an ongoing issue with Nike. My daughter always wears Nike trainers and football boots. I recently bought her football boots costing €216 which cut her heals after wearing for 30 minutes. I returned the boots to Nike and after numerous phone calls I received an email from Nike informing me that the value of the boots plus postage were refunded on a digital giftcard (€237). After using the giftcard for one purchase of €28, I checked the balance of the card and it is €37. I have emailed and phoned Nike customer care a number of times but this issue has not been resolved. On one phone call the customer service agent hung up the phone! A very disappointing service from such a large company. At this point, I want my money refunded and no longer want the value on a giftcard.",04 September 2022,IE

They offered little to no assistance and I had to find out for myself that the order had been lost and had to inform them of this. I’ve contacted them over 10 times to seek assistance and received nothing but useless comments one of their agents even ended our chat while I was trying to seek assistance! They are quick to take your money and ask for reviews on your purchases but other then that prove to be completely incompetent and any even provide me with a simple email to update me or to proof that my order was refunded. They don’t update you and I have had to follow up consistently to get feedback otherwise I wouldn’t even know what has happened with the order .",03 September 2022,ZA

I asked customer sales could I speak to someone who would help and was told to hang up - Nike is this anyway to treat customers a system that lets you order , but items are not available you then have money that is pending that will take 2 to 7 days to be released!! No checking no apologies , and item still shows stock that I can put in my basket and checkout again with so why was my order not fulfilled?",01 September 2022,GB

Theodor Tomas,"Tried ordering some shoes, but the first problem I encountered was that they don't ship to Cyprus where I live even though it is in the EU nor do they accept credit cards with a billing address from Cyprus. Found an alternative solution, or so I thought. I was going to have my friends pick up the shoes in Hungary and bring them here and use my Danish Paypal to pay, something that their website seemed to support. After arranging that I went to order the shoes, and then I got a message that Danish Paypal doesn't work when ordering things to Hungary. So I then reached out to a customer service agent. I am chatting with him right now. He is the SLOWEST typer I have ever encountered. I wrote this whole review while waiting for his next message. I have been chatting with him for 25 minutes and he has sent 3 messages in total. Still hasn't answered my question since he doesn't fully understand English.How much money are they losing with their crappy online ordering? Why would Nike not just be on Amazon?????",31 August 2022,CY
Beth Borges,I just wanted to say that I highly rate Nike's customer service after having purchased a pair of running shoes for myself and my children. The shoes all turned up very quickly and I needed to return one of the pairs and was very pleasantly surprised to know that Nike accept online exchanges which a lot of places don't now. This was dealt with really quickly and easily with their online chat service and I am just awaiting the new pair! I think customer service has been the best I've had in a while compared to the sub par of lots of other companies when you purchase from them online.,30 August 2022,GB

It was a birthday present for this weekend which I am not going to be able to sort out now. Didn't receive any notification of the cancellation. Spoke to online help who said there was a problem with my billing address.

All I wanted to do was reset my password (couldn’t do it on the app for some reason). She finally was told by a supervisor that my retired mother (original Nike EE) would have to call in.

In the meantime, the order I've made from a smaller store, with much less investment capacity than Nike, was made on Tuesday night and I have just gotten it today (Thursday, 2 days later). The worst thing is, even if the order hasn't shipped yet, I can't cancel it anymore. So I will have to wait for these late products before I can return them. A waste of time and resources.

Nicolle Hannah,"Dreadful customer services. Trainers popped after 7 months. Was told I would get a gift card emailed that was 5 weeks ago. Spent 3hrs on phone, mis informed constantly. Manager is useless, I go away next week and still no trainers to be see. I asked for a replacement but they wouldn't do that either. £206 to last 7 months is a joke.

Jennifer Koenig,"I contacted customer service twice about a pair of Nike Burrow slippers due to lining coming loose and now fully dislodged requesting an exchange. The slippers were a month old first contact second time 3 months old. The nike website advertises want to make an exchange contact us we are happy to help. On 8/23/22 I spoke w/ Raymond and explained the interior is falling apart just 3 months old and I wanted to exchange for a pair not defective. Keep in mind my husband and I spend $500 or so a month with Nike. Raymond read me the policy for returns exchanges that says 60 days unworn unused. I said there is a policy for defective workmanship and I said you can look at the chats I contacted within the first month.  He read the policy again verbatim. I sais sir but if you are telling me Nike doesnt stand behind their products unless unworn thereis an issue and I said please check my acct and see how much money I spend with you guys and if this is how I am going to be treated I am happy to return the 7 pairs we just bought in the last 3 weeks which is over $1500, then requested a supervisor. He replied supervisors dont take calls and only contact via email.  I said sorry but I dont believe that Nike doesnt care about their customers and dont allow customer agents to provide customer service and said this is a defective product and you are ok with saying too bad so sad and he reread me the policy.  Not to mention repeatedly cut me off, lied to me and just didnt want to do his job.",24 August 2022,US
Maria,Customized a pair of cleats. 2 months later they never came. They couldn’t find them and didn’t know where they were. Told me to call UPS. I HAD TO DO THEIR JOB FOR THEM. received an email that they delivered. Ha. They went back to their warehouse. Not to me. NIKE couldn’t resend them once they got to warehouse. They get scrapped. $300 custom made cleats they just couldn’t resend them. How terrible!! And they couldn’t even compensate me except refund me. NIKE sucks!!!,22 August 2022,US
Zoe,"I purchased a pair of trainers for my son four months ago as a lifestyle trainer, they haven't been used for sport or any other purpose which would put strain on the structure of the trainer . They have metal poking out of the back heel which makes them unwearable. I expressed this situation to Nike was told to send them back to Netherlands for inspection. Don't think this process is good enough when you live in UK . Should be able to take them to a Nike store to be replaced . Put me off buying Nike trainers again as this is the second time this has happened . No wonder Nike has no email address for complaints .",22 August 2022,GB

I had to CANCEL my card and reverse because they do not follow up in any capacity once they have your money. Horrible and pretty unsettling experience.",22 August 2022,CA

They are saying there was a problem issuing a refund . Then they said to call them back  with my bank details so they can issue straight away , so I called them and he said he was unable to do that over the phone and will issue an urgent call back from his senior team (I was meant to receive the call yesterday) , The same senior team he can talk to but cannot transfer me through to them!!!! Today I have just spent 45 minutes on the phone to them AGAIN! she wanted an IBAN number to issue a refund . We cannot find it for love nor money!  She has our bank details so I don’t see the problem of just issuing a simple refund . She said she can get someone to call me back within 24 hours then told me it will take up to 5 days as they have no urgent calls .

Cheshire Cat,"""Won"" a pair of purple jordan canyons that I paid almost £180 for kiddos birthday (purchased from the SNKRS live event on 8/8/22, via the Nike SNKR app). Shoes arrived today, smelling of toxic plastic and came with a split in the plastic mesh on the front, that's been glued/repaired on one shoe! Essentially Nike sent these shoes knowing they were faulty !!! Been on Nike chat innumerable times, company don't give a damn.  kiddo is distraught with prospect of returning shoes, and Nike REFUSE to send a replacement for the faulty shoes they sent out, when they're back in stock at the end of August. What happened to customer service, or getting what you pay for? (I didn't agree to buy a pair of seconds!). Will never buy from this company again.

Matthew Sproston,"Defective or potentially fake boot delivered Order no. C00958988548 I ordered the boots on the 2nd of August, they arrived today 4th of August. I opened the box and saw one boot differs to the other. One boot appears to be as advertised. The other looks like a fake logo font differing, finish quality poor, ventilation holes different sizes to the 'real looking' boot, stitching irregularities & errors as well as trim around the heel peeling away. The lettering looks like an arts and crafts accident. Messaged customer services team, they offered an exchange however their system has gone down, they said an email would follow and shut the chat down. No idea when I will be able to change these for a pair presented as advertised and expected from Nike. More alarming is I offered to send pictures of the boots in showing comparisons for them to investigate however they didn't seem interested, no doubt when the boots are returned they will find their way back into stock again. Very concerned I will now be stuck with a product not fit for purpose and £100+ lighter.",04 August 2022,GB

They’re all fake cheery but don’t feel they really care or are bothered. They say one thing then days later find out isn’t the case. Feel very reluctant to ever order again as each time has been an issue. I wouldn’t recommend. Also takes it ages for items to be sent out for some reason and nothing arrives when should, plus items show as in stock when order but by time they’re dispatched it seems they aren’t. Maybe other customers after me get the items, who knows. Expect more than to be just fobbed off with fake overly cheerful unhelpful advisors who don’t give me correct information.",04 August 2022,GB
Cassie Franks,I have had the worst experience dealing with Nike ever in my life.  The customer service is awful and no one from corporate ever contact. I have received the wrong size shoe from a store that was not my fault and it had been heck getting my  Receipt.

Stephanie Porteus,"I ordered sneakers for a birthday.  I was IMMEDIATELY charged for the product.  Three days later I get an email telling me a label was created.  Two days after that, it still says label created.  NO PRODUCT SHIPPED.  I called and was told via automated system that my product will arrive TWO DAYS AGO.   Now, I have to wait an additional 7-10 days to get my money back since the product was NEVER SHIPPED  Shame on this dishonest, disgraceful company.  Advice- buy from a reputable company that does not take your money before they ship the product.  I will be filing a claim with NYS as well.",02 August 2022,US
Andrea Cornelius,I brought a pair of sneakers online I returned them in the store on 6-11-22 they enter my credit card information  wrong… I tried to catch them on the mistake as soon I was aware of it…I was told that I had to wait the 10 days before my money refunded back to me. Here it is almost 2 months later and I still don’t have my money. Very disappointed,01 August 2022,US

Natasha Imlack,My son got a pair of trainers that were not cheap after a couple of days of wearing only a couple hours at a time the rubber came unstuck in more then one place !

Lee Skeet,As a 47 year old who’s been wearing Jordan’s since 10 with over 60 pairs of Jordan shoes alone I’m disgusted with how hard it is to get a pair now when I use to get them in the sales section of most shops but with the way Nike is run now is an absolute shambles… I won a pair of £180 Jordan’s which said we’re being delivered but after a week or so never arrived Nike apologised and told me I was lucky there still had my size and sent a pair which arrived next day then a week later I ordered £300 worth of Jordan clothes again after a week didn’t arrive I called Nike and was told they would look into it… another week passes and I get a call saying I will get a refund in 9 days time ?? So you keeped my money for 3 weeks sold out all of the items I bought over 2 weeks ago absolute joke!!! Congratulations my family are happy that’s the last time I’ll be buying anything from Nike again after 37 years and the woman on the phone finishes with sorry we lost your order twice in a month is there anything else I can do for you today? What a joke,29 July 2022,GB
Dominic Crossman,"I have been a customer for a few years with nike.com. And today I am so disgusted and disappointed in the way they are handling the loss of my delivery. Telling me about next week, they will get back to me. I ordered customised trainers 20 pound short of 200 pound. And today I got a notification saying its been delivered to my house, its for my wife's birthday. Which is next week. To find it isn't at my address. I have waited weeks for this. Not acceptable, more needs to he done. Than just fobbing off me off!!",28 July 2022,GB
Ian.,"Braintree Essex store : requested an item in a different size, showing 4 items however staff really can’t be bothered.  Mentioned this at the checkout whilst paying for some other items with the non-bothering member of staff laughing.What sort of customer service is this.Is their motivation to put off customers returning?Nike management you really need to focus on customer service at the Braintree outlet store.",27 July 2022,GB

Isaac,"I want to express again how incredibly unhappy I am that I decided to purchase a product on Nike’s website. The product was shipped, UPS said they couldn’t find the address (which makes no sense as they had delivered one product from the same purchase no problem), eventually the product was marked as “receiver refused delivery” (which was not true as they never came to our door) and returned to their warehouse. When I contacted them I was told to repurchase the product and that I would get a refund for it. When I went to the website the product was no longer there, so I was told I would receive a refund for my previous purchase. I asked whether they could not just send me back the product that had clearly arrived at their warehouse and was told that wasn’t possible. I purchased the item 2 months ago and was told I would get a refund 3 weeks ago. The refund has come through, but I’m still disappointed at the way the whole situation was dealt with.Their customer service is just disgraceful! I can’t even express how stressful this has all been and making an online purchase with such a well known company should never be this stressful. Unsatisfied does not even begin to express what I’m feeling. Incredibly disappointed that Nike does not care about how their customers are treated.",24 July 2022,IE
John Fox,"Where to begin? What to omit?I’m not going to buy Nike again after this experience. 1. They discontinued a brilliant shoe. 2.Their chat service unable to tell me the nearest equivalent current product line. Useless!3.I wanted to email an enquiry, website doesn’t facilitate that by any method.4. When I contacted them to explain my personal circumstances and my disability’s impact by the failure of a pair of shoes purchased in April 2022 and now unwearable, Nike staff member failed to grasp the urgent need for me to replace my faulty shoes. I’ve been unable to go outside for six days because of your incompetence. 5.Their dispatch process cannot be interrupted once an order has been submitted by a customer. Why not? If the status is ‘order sent to warehouse’ then a human intervention should at least be possible.6.Eventual delivery of new ordered shoes marred by unsealed packaging. What wasn’t in the box that should’ve been there? I have no idea! No info found on Nike website for providing  feedback or seeking post-delivery assistance. Clearly Nike not interested in customers’ experience of its delivery arrangements with Evri. Why did they switch from excellent DPD? Given all the above, not a fine experience. And a lost, previously loyal customer.",24 July 2022,GB
Matt rockwood,Recently placed order.  Item never arrived.  Nike said needed to wait 3 days past delivery date on item that was said to be delivered .  After 3 days told their shipping said it was not delivered even though what I received said it was.  Told item was refused and shipped back.  Not the case .  We have surveillance system to verify item never attempted to be delivered.  Item was birthday gift.  I understand mistakes happen.  Then was told that instead of sending back to me when received I could no longer get item.  That makes no sense.  You have item that I paid for but you going to sell to someone else and make me waited weeks for refund.  I thought Nike was better than that. I was wrong.  Scrambling to find last minute gift and Nike still has my money. Crooked if you ask me.  Buyers beware .,22 July 2022,US

I contacted Nike via online chat, the support assistant was unable to provide an answer as to where the package was, I asked to speak to a manager, was transfered to someone called Renzo who said he would review the chat, he then disconnected and I'm unable to reconnect to the chat service. I then called via the phone and didn't get much further. Will not use Nike again as they can't at the minimum tell you where or when the products you have ordered and paid for will be delivered.

CSI,Nike customer service is terrible.  After waiting 2 weeks for a replacement shoe for one that was sent in error and took over 3 weeks to arrive until he first place.  I finally had to ask for a refund and I’m still not confident it will be done anytime soon.  This is unacceptable from any company but especially from a large corporation such as Nike I would have expected a prompt resolution to their error.  I don’t recommend shopping there to anyone and will not be giving them any more money.  It’s awful how they treat people and the lack of respect they show for customers,20 July 2022,CA

Your quick enough to bring out all these new trainers so people can give you there hard earned cash but when I have just received someCortez sp they are so badly made.

Cortez sp,airmax 90 running club,tn plus running club,furyosa,s. It’s disgusting the material is so so cheap I suggest you fix up the amount of money you make.",16 July 2022,GB
Pac Mac,Becoming more bothered about taking peoples money than providing quality products. Received some Cortez sp trainers. They look good in the pictures (as always😂) but when I opened them up they are so badly made. Who makes these trainers some poor Vietnamese people that you probably pay £10 a year. Maybe if you gave them a pay rise they would start to produce better quality footwear. What’s with the new design tongues on the Cortez the airmax 90 running club the furyosa what an earth is this dodgy cheap material you are now using. Every pair of trainers I receive with this material as the tongue is always frayed. What a joke. Dunlop and gola trainers have better materials than Nike. I can’t send them back because they have sold out everywhere!!!!!  Thanks again Nike for selling me a pair of poorly made trainers. I thought you have quality inspection??  Change your Moto to NIKE DONT DO IT if I was you. You are conning people out of hard earned money!! My 5 year old son could make better footwear than your people. Get a grip and sort your materials out. Absolutely disgusting. Been wearing nike since the 1980.s but not no more. I feel I’ve been conned. If you want I’ll upload pictures of about 10 Nike trainers that are brand new boxed and show how poorly made they are. Fix up,16 July 2022,GB

I have just ended yet another call as the promised call was yet again not received yesterday, only to be told it has been escalated again and a manager will call within 48hrs.We are a sports mad family but I will never buy another Nike product.

Clare Smith,"Very poor customer service, had some IDs stolen in delivery. Was given a refund then locked out my account and can't re order. First I spoke to Francess he incompetence was visible as had written no noted from the call, Maria picked up. Then she had put notes on for Nikolay. They would rather lose a customer than  sort out the issue with theft which had been slapped all over the news about the products being stolen by postmen. I expect I'm going to be purchasing from footlocker if not sorted today as Maria stated on a recorded call. I will be retrieving these and posting transcripts. About time nike took accountability to their member or why have a subscription for members. Seems like a total lack of customers service or the need to want to help. No some fool rocking around with my sons name on the back of the shoe. Nike also stop putting your branding on the outside of packages asking dor trouble. And us customers are at a loss.

Marilyn Thomas,"If I could leave no stars, then I would. The Canadian Nike customer service REPS (plural, had to call back multiple times) were absolutely incompetent. Nike obviously outsources to Asia because I had to rephrase, repeat, rephrase, repeat. I taught English in Japan for two years, so I have a good ear for deciphering poor English, but this was a hopeless situation. Bottom line.....if you need to contact customer service in Canada, be prepared for erroneous information, apathetic representatives and an overall frustrating experience. Repeated requests to speak to a supervisor were declined as no one was supposedly available. Also, I kept getting cut off, probably because of the connection to the Phillipines. No more Nikes for me. I am on a mission to share my horrible experiences as it appears Nike couldn't care less. Keep the jobs in Canada where they belong so people don't need an interpreter. With the prices you charge, I'd expect my representative to speak fluent English.",07 July 2022,CA

These new pants are terrible, they have faded to the point of being unrecognizable. The pants he got 10 years ago have faded better than these new ones. My dad called to ask about the policy and the guy he talked to directed him to corporate. Corporate was closed, it was a Sunday. When he finally got to talk with corporate we were told to pay to have them mailed into headquarters and they would decide whether or not the pants were not up to quality.

I Didn't receive any refund, so sometime in May I contacted Nike and was told that I didn't confirm whether or not I wanted the refund, and that I didn't give them my mailing adress, even though my return adress was on the box that I sent the sneakers in. I still didn't get any refund, so I contacted Nike again, and was told that they don't know what happened, but that the refund for $95 is in the mail and that if I don't get it by the end of June I should contact them.

Please realise that this is 2022 and the Equalities act is in place to protect Women who are disadvantaged due to their sexual orientation and pregnant. My daughter was physically not in a position to queue up today, if she was feeling stronger then she would have waited like everyone else, but today was a really bad day.

Martin McNulty,"I’ve been a loyal Nike.com customer for years and never had any problems with customer service, that is until the start of 2022. I had to chase up 2 refunds earlier this year and had to provide proof of postage on both occasions- never had to do this before, but I got the refunds. In December I bought 6 pairs of running shoes, 3x size 8.5 and 3x size 9 at a cost of £599.82, the 8.5’s were a bit too small so I returned these for a refund of £299.91 which I received shortly after. One of the size 9’s had 2 small holes in the front of the right shoe so I returned these for a replacement. I then started to wear the first pair when I was out running, these only lasted for around 50 miles so I contacted Nike and they told me to send all 3 pairs back. I did this on 20th April, they received them back on 23rd April as I obtained a proof of delivery from the Post Office. Since then I have been on phone calls, live chats and emails for hours upon hours trying to get this further refund of £299.91. On 25th May I was sent an email confirming that my return had been received and they had refunded my £299.91 back to my credit card, they said it would take between 5-9 days for the refund to process. 9 days later no refund. Long story short, I have received an email today saying they haven’t received my return, despite me sending them the proof of postage and proof of delivery. So either the shoes have went missing, or they’re calling me a liar. 64 days after I returned the order I’m no further forward and have no faith whatsoever that I’ll ever see this money back. I’ve genuinely never had such appalling customer service and if I could give them no stars I would. Until I get my refund I’m going to continuously troll them on social media until I get my money back. I doubt very much that I’ll ever use Nike.com again",23 June 2022,GB

Simbarashe Ernest Marowa,"THINK TWICE B4 BUYING ONLINE FROM NIKE.COM !!!!!I am still bewildered by the fact that I have been repeatedly told to wait up to 8 working days for a pair of trainers that were stated as UNDELIVERABLE by their couriers via their own tracking app they gave me access to. Customer service guy tells me that his system that is real-time shows him goods in transit. So they say they want to investigate and withhold my my refund even though HERMES/EVRI has misappropriated my trainer deliveries in the past, as recent as a week ago. Like my NIKE trainers but sadly will never again order them online from Nike.com. I never have issues with dpd.",21 June 2022,GB

All I wanted was the products resent, had the hardest time to get to this point!

Carrie Anne,"Nike is not my go to running shoe but when i recieved a pair of Nike zoom runners as a gift i decided to use them as my work shoes. My 1st day wearing them i noticed they are super squeeky. It sounds like i am at a basketball game all day long. I do like the shoe. After i put my ortotics in, they are super comfortable but i absolutely hate the sqeeking all the time. I dislike it so much that i will probably not be sporting Nike kicks after these shoes. They look good and feel good which is important but the sqeeking will stop me from purchasing them ever.",14 June 2022,CA
Bryan,"I went to three different stores to buy the Blazer Low ‘77 Vintage shoes. All stores were out of my size, which is fine, but when I asked if one of the salesmen could order them online and have them shipped to me, none of them would. I came home and ordered online, waited three weeks, and the shoes didn’t come in. I called Nike, and the shoes had been lost in a warehouse by FedEx, so Nike issued a return and re-ordered the same shoes. I waited another week and saw that the shipment hadn’t started, so I called Nike once more and was told the rep I spoke with last time ordered incorrectly in the system, so the shoes never went out. I asked to order a third time, but the shoes were now entirely out of stock. I was issued a refund but not told it would take 7 to 10 days to clear, so I had to wait to order my final pair of shoes. I missed two concerts, two photo shoots, and a video promo shoot that I had intended on using the these shoes for. I cannot express my disappointment with the way this was handled enough.",13 June 2022,US

Raised this with Nike customer service after waiting two weeks and making several calls I was advised that I would not be receiving a refund as they dispatched the item correctly and therefore are not liable. I challenged this and was then told that I had not provided a valid address. The address provided was a business address that I get all parcels sent to if we are closed come back the next day ?

I had two cards and even paypal got this message, one of the cards is MasterCard Platinum, so credit is no problem. I did add my credit card yesterday evening and try to ""test Order"" a pair of shoes, and all went well yesterday.

I don’t think they even ran 10k! Assuming they were a faulty pair I tried to get an exchange. As I bought them at a sale price they said there were none of my size anywhere I couldn’t get an exchange. Even to the 1/2 size up (ordered a 6.5 - they had 7 in stock). Then 6.5 came into stock anyway, so I returned, for an exchange, only to find out the shoes went back up to full price and if I wanted another pair I would need to pay the (£100) extra.

Garry Geddes,"Nike don’t deserve a star but you’re not giving an option are you trustpilot.NIKE DON’T HAVE A COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE In place in the uk when things go wrong, as I have fund out from the USA to my expense! I wanted to make a complaint about a random raffle they had on 28/4/22 for a pair Nike Dunk low SB Habanero Red (Bart Simpson shoes) I was blocked as well as lots of other people from entering this Random raffle for the shoes.The Best part of this complaint is that Nike had informed me that i did not select the item in the raffle not that they call it that, they call “ the draw “ it’s supposed to be a random draw which it's not.A lot of people ware blocked from entering the draw were bing blocked by blocking software it’s quite easy to do via a VPN+onionIf someone from NIKE just happens to look at this PLEASE have a look on EBAY and you will see hundreds of shoes all being sold by the same person using a different IP of course. He will add in different shoes sizes into the mix of course There is some genuine sellers there but majority of them are being sold by the same person. NIKE have assured there customers that there is software in place to stop people buying multiple orders. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING NIKE !!!? You could have stop this from happening by reducing the time of draw to 5 minutes as 15 minutes is a long time you can do a lot of damage in that time.This is so unfair to most of us honest members and on your 50th anniversary as well, so unfair.There is only one way you can pay them back is General release of the shoe that will hurt him.

In most crucial moment, suddenly, the site was not able to verify my payment in case of credit card.

Stephen Keen,Purchased a pair of Nike 720 in March 2020. Noticed that the left trainer sole is deflated. Looked online and discovered this is a known fault with this trainer. Contacted Nike who parroted the ‘2 year warranty mantra’ they couldn’t care less or take into account for a year of that time we were in lockdown. So I now have a pair of trainers with very little wear that cost £154 that are useless! And because I am slightly out of the warranty Nike literally just flip you the finger when you contact them.

Mandy,"Purchased a pair of 'WHITE' Nike Max 95 at a cost of £150 for my Son. Wore them 6-7 times & the white LEATHER (prob plastic), turned creamy yellow after my Son wore them out in the rain - do not see any info stating only to be worn in dry weather?? I would probably understand if the Canvas part of the Trainers discoloured, but for the Leather to turn a creamy yellow is quite strange.  I have called Nike today & the advisor 'Eroco' informed me that the same thing happened to him when he wore a pair (not exactly the best recommendation for the Company who pay him his salary). He advised that I send them back at my own expense - as if the £150 I paid for the 'Horrific Quality' Trainers isnt enough of a payment. In my position in Consumer Resolution, I will be following this up and gathering all the reviews posted, so please continue to post your personal experience - both good & bad. However, my cheap white fake unbranded Trainers are still perfectly white after 6mths of almost daily wear and cost me £29.99. Avoid expensive Nike at all cost.",05 May 2022,GB

When i opened the box,the actual shoebox was not the correct box that the shoes should be in which would be a move to zero cardboard box. These showed up in a basic orange box,  You could tell the label had been peeled from another box and stuck on the incorrect box they showed up in and not in the right spot. I am a collector and  to me this de values my purchase not having the correct box. They asked me for pictures and then proceed to tell me they cant send me a box. Ive asked many times for an explanation of why they even showed up in the incorrect box and never got an answer.

Harley,"WORST COMPANY TO DEAL WITH!!I order some air max on 9th April, i received an email on the 12th to ay they had been delivered with a photo attached of them being left sat on top of communal bins, not in the bin or put somewhere safe just sat on top of the bin in clear sight for anyone, shock horror that when i get home the parcel wasn't there! (not like it was left in plane view of the whole main road!) reported this to nike who agreed it was left on top of a bin and would investigate, over a week later still no shoes and still no response from nike! it is there responsibility for their delivery companies incompetence yet i am the one suffering having to chase them everyday and not have my items!! i will never use them again i would rather go through a 3rd party at least they have customer service skills!!",21 April 2022,GB
Pingu Blazer,Recently purchased Air Force 1 and mid blazer 77 from nike.com. (UK address(Leeds)) The estimated delivery was approx 4-5days. It’s now been a week and 3days. No update on the delivery from Hermes. Nike.com couldn’t track the package. I got a refund. Never ordering from nike again. Waste of time and money.,20 April 2022,GB
Kel,Shoes didn’t get delivered due to floods. Offered a refund 2 months later still waiting for refund. No wonder you make so much money you rip off people.

Julie,"If Nike is an American multinational corporation that is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, then why are there literally four pairs of shoes that are sold in mens wide? It’s frustrating and disappointing that this multi-billion dollar company doesn’t understand that everyone’s foot is not a M. My options are black mesh with a white swoosh, or black mesh with a black swoosh. My conversation with customer support was a waste of time. For my frustration, they gave me 10% off, and I literally just told them I cannot find shoes, but here’s 10% off, SMH. I am beyond frustrated with Nike.",16 April 2022,US
Haroon Nasar,Absolutely awful customer service. Staff are either stupid or liars. I just want my money back. If a manager can give me a call I’d like to discuss the 2 previous agents who I spoke to. One seems to think Europe is a county. The other seems to think 9 working days is how long a transaction takes to get refunded. I was lied to that my bank details were updated however they wasn’t. Just get this sorted and give me a callUpdate 25/AprilIt has now been 9 days since my last interaction with Nike. I was given no further update. I still haven’t received the refund I am due.,16 April 2022,GB

They won't offer me a refund even though I do not have my order for over a month.Plus, when placed on hold, have been disconnected several times as well.  Horrible experience.",13 April 2022,CA

Terri Robinson,"Wow.  Very surprised to see that Nike had such low reviews.  I placed an order on April 1, 2022, received an email confirmation for the order the same day.  On April 3, 2022, I received another email stating that my order hadn't shipped yet but was still on schedule.  On schedule, NOT!!!  I called on April 8, 2022 to inquire about the order and was informed that the order cancelled just this morning.  What the heck...No notification of cancellation was received.  Unsatisfactory on ALL levels.  Well guess what, they charged me when the order was placed but I must wait 3-4 days for reimbursement.  Disappointed in NIKE to say the least.  Next time, I'll read the reviews first, shame on me for not reading the reviews.  Lesson well taught!",08 April 2022,US
H.B.,"The user experience of this site is horrific to say the least. I had an item in my basket for which I had bought a gift voucher specifically for and at the very last step of the purchase flow and after clicking ""Pay"" I was informed that the item is out of stock! How can you allow an item to be snatched away from you when you are on the payment steps?! That's completely outrageous! Customer service agent was completely unhelpful telling me that they can't refund the gift voucher and that I could be on the lookout for more stock (no sh@t!) or spend it elsewhere on the site! I explained that I was not looking at wasting £83 anywhere on their useless site but I wanted just that specific item. Unacceptable experience that I'll make sure I won't put myself through again by trying to buy from them.",08 April 2022,GB

Pheonix Marketing LTD.,"The worst. Myself and my partner have both been loyal nike customers for years … and after the last year we are both left stunned at the appalling quality nike clothes holds as well as their shoe size availability and overall lack of supply. My partner is an XL In both tops and bottoms, of any brand, not just Nike. He has been struggling with the few recent styles of tracksuits because although the XL clothes seem to be getting wider, the arm lengths seem to be getting shorter. Honestly, he looks like a buffoon most times when trying his new Nike clothes on. The amount of times we went based off trust and grabbed his size off the shelves to only be getting home and feeling disappointed. On top of it all, their quality check on clothes is appalling. Endless loose threads, wonky tags and an overall disappointing finish to what’s meant to be a brand that ‘performers’ use. To top it all off, his latest pair of Nike joggers had NO STRING INSIDE ??? Seems to me they care more about pocketing money, increased profit margins and are heavily affecting their image doing so. How much longer do they think they can literally mug us all off? I have a large social media following I’m going to be sure to post this up and expect a Nike reply from it. Lol. I’d rather go Primark and get joggers now, at least I know I am paying for what I’m getting.",07 April 2022,GB

Steven Upshaw,"I recently bought a pair of trainers whilst I was in the USA using the USA Nike website. I've come back to the UK noticing that the quality is not up to standard. When I buy an expensive shoe from Nike, I expect the quality to be top-notch if I plan on having them for at least two years.I've come back and contacted Nike UK customer services asking if I can get these sent to a hub in the UK for an exchange/replacement and they've said no. They've told me I cannot initiate a return online and that I have to take it to a Nike Store for them to be looked at.My nearest open Nike Store is 70km away.I'm really unhappy with this service. Nike is a reputable globalised brand and this is just unacceptable in this day and age.Katarzyna - one of the lovely advisors I spoke to was a great help and she was more than happy to go out of her way to make sure the logistics of my request get looked into be a senior member.

Holly,"I ordered some custom Dunks in January 2022 and never got them. When I got in contact with Nike CS in February to chase the order I was told they had been delivered to a Go Outdoors. I wasn't told about this, I was never contacted. So when I was told about the store, I went to collect the shoes, but they weren't there. So I tried to contact the person I had spoke to at Nike, she finally got back in touch and said I must have missed the cut off point (however I would have been within the 10 days if the dates she told me were correct). I was told to be patient as they were going back to them, and an investigation would open and they would be sent back out to me. I wait till March, sending 3 emails to ask for an update, to which I got no reply. I went back to Nike CS and had to re-explain the situation, all I am offered is a full refund to re-order them or to continue to wait. So I said will it be more than a month again as I am moving, I was told probably not. So I agree to wait. End of March comes around, no contact from anyone, no sign of the shoes so I had to get back in contact and ask again, re-explain to a third person and get told the same thing, still 'under investigation' and all they can offer is a refund to re-order. I even said if you can give me the refund and a discount I would accept that, they wouldn't even do that. So after waiting months, I have finally requested a full refund. What a waste of time. Hopefully the money comes back into my account with no problems because I can't go through is a third time. Waste of time, money and stress.",30 March 2022,GB

David Bewers,"I ordered 2 pairs of Trainers from Nike who uses Hermes (Now Evri) as their Courier. The parcel has gone 'missing' with the Courier which translates to it's been stolen (this is not the first time I have had this happen with this courier). I tried contacting Hermes about this but they do not answer their phones, ever. I did find one phone number that charged me £6.67 for a 10 second phone call where I didn;t manage to speak to anyone.I have tried speaking to Nike on 2 separate occasions, both times they were not prepared to assist me - on my second attempt I asked to speak to a manager. The person I was speaking to said he has to make a request for me to speak with a manager who will then call me back in 1-3 days, but my request was immediately denied. I asked him to request this again and apparently it was denied again.The situation to date is I have paid £250 ish for 2 pairs of trainers plus a £6.67 phone call, I have made countless phone calls to Nike, I have tried online chats and other means of contact with Hermes (Now Evri) all of which have got me absolutely no where.Nike are refusing to refund me my money until Hermes have 'concluded their investigation' - an investigation that Hermes/Evri have completely ignored.For such an enormous multi billion pound company it astounds me that they can provide such an awful service.I could never understand why companies use Hermes/Evri as their courier because they are complete crooks but now it makes sense - the companies like Nike use Hermes/Evri because they don't care about their customers.Shame on you Nike.",28 March 2022,GB

So I’m currently out of pocket of £217 whilst they keep my money and someone somewhere ends up with my returned items.

Adam Renouf,"I honestly think that nike give little regard to customers and their “customer service” team seem to go out of their way to be as unhelpful as possible and throw in a little bit of belittling for good measure. I processed a refund after my order was left in a pickup location (if the order had have come when they advised someone would have been in) to which accessing the box was impossible as I was told to scan a qr code, but there was no scanner on the machine. So I let it get sent back, I then had to message them off my own back to start the refund even though they had received it. The person who “dealt“ with the refund said it would take up to 10 working days. A joke. But still I waited and did. Not receive my refund on the 10th day because the person who processed it forgot to do it. I then had to message again to chase and was then told another wait for up to 9 days. A joke. After chasing again the next day the ‘customer service’ representative said she asked them to do it quicker. This should have been done anyway after their error. Then was belittled and had my questions constantly avoided by the unhelpful staff team.

MB,"If there were negative stars that is what I would select. I was placing an online order when the site told me it could not be placed because it ´timed out’. So I sent the order again. About 30-40 minutes later I received two emails about two minutes apart showing two orders of the same item. I called customer service and was cut off 5 times. When I made it through I was told they cannot cancel the order because it was greater than 30 minutes after the order was placed. Where do they tell you this?  On the website when you attempt to cancel an order and certainly not when you are placing it! Fast forward 2 days and the order has not shipped which is totally fine. What is not fine is that you cannot cancel an order that has not shipped. I could probably return a half eaten chicken to Costco for goodness sakes. On the Canadian site I find terms of service saying you can cancel an order any time before it is shipped. So I call customer service again and got the same representative and supervisor I spoke with 2 days prior. After being back and forth on hold for 30 minutes they tell me those are the terms of service only if you are ordering from China! I ask to speak with someone higher and the supervisor tells me they don’t provide anyone higher. So, while consumers are all helping Phil Knight get a few more billion in his bank account, Nike is leaving 2 people (who are probably not paid what their experience is worth) to deal with an exceptionally poor cancellation policy without any further recourse. Nike will spend more time/money/carbon to ship the duplicate item only to have me return it (unless there is some fine print I missed there) than to simply cancel what is clearly a duplicate order that has not even shipped. The fact that a multi-billion dollar company cannot afford to have a better customer care process/experience in place baffles me. The company can and should do better. Given the many other negative reviews posted, it seems for Nike the service motto should be the customer is never right.",07 March 2022,CA

Marco k,"I went to the store in Utrecht Hoog Catharijne and saw some Nike dunk retro panda’s that i wanted to purchase for either me (size 43)or my girl (size 39-40). These shoes are hard to come by so i was willing to take a bargain on the size 40,5 that they had in the store. You would think that this would be an easy purchase. I can tell/assure you that it was the contrary. The staff told me that i could not buy this shoe because that was not my size and if my girlfriend wanted them she had to come and buy them herself. I was speaking to S and N ( who implied she was the manager, but honestly if that was the manager you might be better of appointing a third grader and he/she might even be better at communicating politely)  and they told me that it is Nike’s policy and they cannot sell the shoes to me. I was flabbergasted at best. So in other words my girlfriend has to take a day off to buy her own shoes or she has to pay resell in the range of 250€ or more. I am very disappointed in how Nike handled it also when i called the customer service to help me with this issue. They told me that there was nothing they could do about it and that i should contact headquarters. I subsequently asked for the email or telephone of these headquarters but they couldn’t provide me with that information either.

Try avoid it if you can its really not worth it especially when you pay way above the odds for ""custom trainers""",25 February 2022,GB
Josh Fritts,"Absolutely terrible customer care. The representatives are polite and kind on the phone, but actual product support policy is terrible. Spent $90 on a pair of Flex RN runners and just over a year later both shoes had worn holes through on the TOP side over the toes. Shoes supposedly have a 2 year warranty period for defects. It doesn’t get much more obvious than this as far as defects. However, they denied my claim and stated it was normal wear and tear. What a joke. Terrible product support.",24 February 2022,US

Upset customer,"I purchase a pair of Nike trainers for my son via JD Sport, the loop that holds the lace in place has come out.  I would like a replacement as the laces have no way of holding the trainer on his foot while running or working out. JD Sport have said I have to post them back or take them to the store, they then send them back and someone will assess if they need replacing, This will take up to 14 days, the funds will then take time to process.   I spoke to Nike as they were their brand hoping they will have a faster system and they have taken no responsibility for suppling faulty trainers.  I know my purchase is a tiny drop in the ocean to Nike but they have lost s customer.",21 February 2022,GB

My disappointment using the SNKRS app is when using the raffle system & loosing (I’m not normally a bad looser) it’s very disappointing to see these trainers straight on E-bay at largely inflated prices.  Why not sell to people who want to use your product rather than someone after a quick profit.,17 February 2022,GB

Contacted Nike as not had update to be told only then that they are out of stock (?) what a waste of time. Don’t buy online.. go to shop!

They kept saying the shoes were on sale already - does that mean we deserve this type of stupid service simply because the shoes were on sale? What kind of logic that is!

Like the shoes, online orders are terrible. Will not do this again, only in store purchase with Nike or you will be in for some grief.I will be contacting Nike through chat each day until the return is complete. I don't care if this bogs down their support, I just want them to complete the return in a timely way as promised!It is now Jan 31 and still no refund.

Still no refund.Item is tracked and I can see it was returned and they even confirmed it.Customer service team refuse to put you through to a manager and continuously give the same scripted response. They are literally zero use to anyone.I provided receipts and proof of the return on top of everything else and now I'm apparently escalated to the next level to get a refund.So no refund. No complaints department and no opportunity to speak to a manager. But you do get some form of robot human hybrid telling you 'they got you' over and over and over while doing absolutely nothing to help.An utter disgrace of a company that clearly wants to pretend. After all, if you have no method of complaints then no one can complain therefore you can tell yourself you are awesome.

On the 4th of Jan she got a message from Hermes saying that an issue has occurred and to give them 1 day to fix it. 2 days later same issue so she went and used Nike customer chat support, they told her it will be fixed in 1-2 business days. 1 week later still no reply, I took over and chatted with customer support they said the same thing 1-2 days and it will arrive. After waiting 5 days, today I contacted them again and apparently, the shoes got lost, and the only offer they gave is for it to be reshipped. I asked for any type of compensation, esp since we didn't get any notice that it was lost and the first 2 contacts were horrible. The only thing offered was a 10% compensation for a future purchase. So my birthday gift never came, they never notified us that it was lost, after contacting them twice as well they didn't notify us that it was lost.

Wingdone Oni,Initially contacted them because their order sytem kept putting me in a loop and unable to complete the order even though i had authorizations on my account. chat agents kept asking me to take screenshot of my account which i cannot possibly do because of the bank's security policy which physically doesnt let you do that. managed to take a picture from.another screen but the idiot i spoke to said it wasn't from them and ended the chat. I already explained i was using 3rd party payment system which is an option on their website ie paypal so it shows paypal instead. i phoned instead and spoke to this lovely lady who understood right away. but the chat agents were like talking to a brick wall. i don't get it. im sure they would have been trained about 3rd party payment. why put that as an option if the agents know nothing about it. i just needed confirmation that it's not a charge. 😑,11 January 2022,GB
Vai Via,Lesson learned: Don’t purchase online if you’re not 100% sure of your size or else the refund process will take a month or 2! I returned a pair of sneakers and I anticipated the week process.

Spoke to customer services who just said that they always work on improving the experience or something generic like that. No offer of replacement at same price etc. The trainers are now back at full price (albeit not in my size). Absolute garbage to take an order and then take two weeks to cancel it. Good job it wasn't a present. When they say ""Just Do It"" I expect just that! Recommend sticking to other sports outlets.",10 January 2022,GB
Ellie,Nike have recently had a sale where they had some vapormax 50% off. I ordered a pair on the 30th December and got told they had been dispatched however I never received them and after looking into the matter I was told that they had been lost in transit which Nike did not update me to let me know. When I asked to have them resent as I got a £199 pair of vapormax for £89 they told me that they were out of stock so I requested if I could just choose the same pair in a different colour that was in stock but they refused and said they will just give me 15% code or I could choose another pair of trainers in a lower price bracket meaning that I could not get vapormax. Therefore I thought I was getting a really good deal with Nike but clearly not. I am disgusted with the service as I am usually a Nike customer and I am just shocked that all they could seem to offer me was a pair already on sale in a colour that isn't very nice and 15% code. I am not sure I will be shopping with them again as they can not guarantee you will get your order if it is on offer. Not happy.,10 January 2022,GB

Joe Brown,"I ordered my nephews a £50 Nike gift voucher each for Christmas via the official Nike.com site on 21 December, for delivery to my address as we were having our family Christmas gathering on 2 January. I get that it was close to Christmas, but estimated delivery was 30 December so no problem I thought. By 31 December the order status was still 'preparing package' so I used the chat function... the person on the other end made the right noises about investigating but nobody got back to me. I tried the chat function again on January 2 - again, the right noises were being made but no actual action... I said it was pointless sending to me now and requested the address be changed to theirs, as I'd only be posting them again when they eventually arrived. They said no problem, note added to change the address. It gets to yesterday - 5 January - status still 'package being prepared' so I get onto the chat function for a third time to find out what is going on... it's just two vouchers and it had by then been two weeks wait with no information. Again, apologetic, and they said all they could suggest was to cancel and refund so I said fine, do that. Imagine my surprise when late last night - six hours after they agreed to cancel the order - I receive an email saying they'd been dispatched. They arrived today, wonderful, but to add insult to injury they arrived here and weren't sent to my nephews as agreed so I now have to pay for postage additionally. It's been a comedy of errors and zero information, I will be pursuing them for my postage costs as a point of principle.",06 January 2022,GB
Steve,I ordered pair of airmax 270 December 18 and still no shoes on my feet.I’ve asked multiple times for my money back and get same response of just have to wait for shoes to either get to me our return back to Nike.Pretty embarrassing how big company sucks so bad to get shoes to there customers.,06 January 2022,CA
Nida Naseem,I did not start the return process from my Nike account BUT returned the shoes with the labels provided. Never got a refund as they could not track. WHAT IS THIS BEHAVIOUR. I called Customer Service. I told them I have proof of postage but no body card. I never got my £50 and the shoes were gone too.,06 January 2022,GB
Nina,They returned my items to the warehouse without even attempting to deliver the items (I was self-isolating at the time) despite me spending over £200 on gifts. They tried to offer a 10% discount code to compensate and their advise was 'for the future its safer to get the items delivered to a pickup location' as though a multimillion pound company can't be trusted to post items.,05 January 2022,GB
niamh tobin,"If I could give 0 stars I would, I recieved a package before Christmas, it was a Christmas present for my partner. When I opened a clean dry box there was a saturated pair of track suit bottoms, when opened the tags and white paper had stuck to the tracksuit bottoms, the 2 packs of white socks were black, dirty and stained with the wet, and two other pairs of tracksuit bottoms were fine with the exception of the smell of dampness off them. I have been trying to get through to them since before Christmas, one person offers me a refund or exchange, another has offered me a refund for the damaged items and not having to send them back, and now I've been told a refund or exchange again bit I have now washed the items and I was told that I shouldn't have washed them. They were a Christmas present, I couldn't afford to go out ans buy all new stuff a week before Christmas so I had no other choice then to wash them. I have bought frequently from nike and apart from the long shipping time I've never had any issues except now. This issue has definitely made me think twice about ordering from their website again",03 January 2022,IE

Kenneth McKay,"I ordered two apparel items back in February.  I was patient as they had the disclaimer saying orders may be delayed due to ""Covid"" issues.  I would check their website for status updates every 60 days and ut would state ""still awaiting a pickup by their shipping company"".  In December.  Their website still says it hasnt been picked up by their shipper.  I called to inquire and first they said the order was delivered and maybe stolen.  I told them their own website says it hasnt even been shipped.  I was then told too bad, theres nothing else we can do and they will not respond to my requests any further because its been too long.   I checked their website one last time today and it still says the order has not been picked up by their shipper.  This is the worst customer service Ive ever experienced.  Horrible.  $131.00 wasted.",01 January 2022,US

Alie Nat,"Nike really need to address their resell problem on their Jordan’s. It is impossible to purchase a pair at retail and It seems on release day you have to win a draw. Clearly those with bots will win the entries which is why after 8 minutes sites like stockx were already selling at more than double the price. There must be some affiliation to keep the item highly sought after. They talk about equality, but there items are becoming more and more out of reach for a lot of people",30 December 2021,GB

Stephen,"Nike you should be ashamed of your customer service We purchased a pair of trainers for just under £100 the trainers were worn on two occasions and the front of the trainers have separated from the sole .Nike customer service are demanding a PDF of the receipt even though we have forwarded the original purchase information .You cannot send screen shots or other documentation in case it has been altered or tampered with but it's ok to send a bank statement with other transactions blanked out , Have Nike never heard of data protection ?.Would you send your bank details to a foreign country?Nike we are in the 21st century not the 1950s you need to treat your customers and your workers fairly or you will be out of business .You may think that your customer base is loyal but if you keep selling cheap tat and charging the earth for it then I'm afraid the end is nigh .There are quite a lot of very negative reviews on Trustpilot for your products So anyone who is thinking of purchasing anything to do with Nike I would suggest you think long and hard on your options if you have a problem with your purchase as there is NO uk support.RegardsSteve",28 December 2021,GB
Ken Hall,Bought Nike shoes in October after a short time one shoe started to squeak. Then at two months old the sole started to separate from the top of the same shoe. They were the only pair I had at the time so I had to glue them back together so I could use them the next day. I called the Nike warranty number and spoke to a representative that told me I would have to send the shoes to them at my expense and would probably not be covered because I glued them. I can’t believe that such a big company would not help me out. Very disappointed and have to replace them myself.,28 December 2021,CA

I gave up the call because I was getting nowhere.  I sent a formal written complaint and no one responded!!!  I called again and requested a refund.  Then had to re-buy the item so that they could send it with a different courier.  They sent it via DPD 48hr delivery, but days later DPD depot has still not received my parcel.

As I guessed, the parcel was lost and they didn’t have another Pair, but would refund me my money.. what annoys me is that they offer this up as if they’re doing you a favour. ‘Yes, we know we’ve ruined your child’s Christmas, but here’s your own money back to make up for it’ appalling and disappointing",22 December 2021,GB

Finally got the return label and returned the shoes. 6 months later I still had no refund, or new pair or shoes or my old ones returned in case that my claim wasn't accepted. Nike kept on saying that they don't have the parcel, I had to send proof of purchase, proof of postage and pictures multiple times (about 10 times). They told me they would call back on various occasions, which obviously never happened. I highly doubt that I'll ever get a refund or my old shoes back.

Definitely has not been issued. They said if I send them my bank statement to prove it hasn't gone through they will look into it.

Robyn,"Absolutely shocking company. Ordered a pair of trainers as a Christmas present, contacted Nike to exchange as I ordered wrong size. Printed off returned label and sent back. In the same time my order tab on Nike stated exchange item is being processed. A week later I contacted Nike, after speaking to two representatives one tried to state I did not use the return label which was emailed to myself. Which I 100% did. Second representative stated it hadn't been scanned as returned. Few days later contacted Nike to be told they would sort it out and keep me updated. Never happened. Fast forward three weeks later and 8 different representatives I was told this morning that they would cancel the order, which they did not. This evening I contacted again to tell them to cancel the order, the response was 'we can look at your options'. After bluntly spelling it out that I have waited three weeks for an exchange that has not moved status and it won't arrive in time for Christmas I demanded it be cancelled. No company should have you chasing and speaking to all different people telling you different stories, lying, false promises etc. Absolute shambles of a company.

I have no idea what they do at Nike but nothing seems to be joined up or work there!

After spending a lot of time on chat, I was able to cancel it. The item arrived almost a month late and I had to make 1 chat and 1 call to figure out how to return it. Nike said that they could not have UPS pick the order up and I would have to drop it off at a UPS store. Then they could not figure out a way to send a return label since the order had been cancelled. So they told me to wait for a few days to receive the return label. The agents were unhelpful.

Sarah,"I had bought a pair of shoes from Nike. When they were delivered I noticed black marks on the shoe that did not rub off and were more like stains. My sister had dealt with Nike customer services before and was really happy as her item was lost on the post, they offered her a full refund plus a 50% promotion code to use on their site. I spoke to customer services in live chat. After sending photos etc I was told there were no shoes in that size left in stock so the only option was a refund. I explained my frustration as if the shoes were quality checked before leaving the warehouse I would not be in this situation and also the shoe is sold out on all other sites including Nike .I was only offered a 20% compensation which I was not happy with .  I went onto say I felt a larger compensation should be given so I can use it to get the shoes professionally cleaned as if I sent the shoes back I would not be able to find another pair before Christmas. The highest discount they could offer me was 20% and there was no real empathy to the situation. After the situation still not being resolved I asked to speak to a manager. Once a manger emailed me they explained the phone lines were not working so it had to be dealt with over email. I explained the situation and the fact they were for a Christmas present . A manger replied and explained there was a custom site where the shoe was similar in style but more expensive. I was given a 20% discount code to bring the shoe down to the original shoes price which is £99. I replied saying I was offered 20% off the originally £99 on the live chat. So with the 20% off the more expensive shoe I would actually be receiving no compensation for the troubles that have been caused. After once again no empathy for the situation or any more support we chose to go with the more expensive shoe just so I would have a Christmas present. The manager then proceeded to tell me that the more expensive shoes take 5-6 weeks to arrive. I was really upset at this point as I stated that They are for a Christmas present and why were they given as an option when they would clearly not be here. The reply I got was once going unipersonal and scripted. The only response I was getting was the best situation would be for you to return the shoe. I was explaining that it is not an option. If I return these shoes I will not be able to get another pair in time for Christmas. The only option is a higher discount to compensate for me having to get them professionally cleaned. I also reiterated that once again this is not our error it was theirs and I would not be in this situation if checks would of been taken. All I felt is I was not being listen to and almost being blamed for the error like it is my problem. I was also frustrated as I know higher discount could be given out but they chose not too. When I replied with the above I was told that 20% discount of the original shoe price was all they could offer and they would now close the case. We took the 20% compensation as we knew it was about to be closed even though our issue wasn’t resolved but £18 to get shoes professionally cleaned does not even cover it. The £18 we received back won’t even cover a clean and also means we received no compensation from the company for all the above. I’ve been with other shoe company’s where say a small area is marked and they offer 60% back as they would be unable to to re sell them such as ego. For a big company for it to be so impersonal I would not buy directly again. Even a gesture of a compensation plus a cleaning kit for the shoe to be sent out would of been more helpful.",14 December 2021,GB

I tried to exchange the shoe from the foot locker that I had purchased it from but they tell me that I have to file a claim. So that's what I tried to do. But my son would be shoeless because during this process they have to get the shoe and inspect it. I'm like totally upset now I'll just take the darn shoe to a shoe repair store and get it fixed!

Days go by and no 20% percent refund, Which leads me to ring them today to be told that they cannot give me the 20% as promised because I had already been given a 10% code from the first pair of trainers that I didn't get, a code that I didn't want need or use.

Soon mentioned a breach of contract under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 helped a little bit so here hoping I get the refund and try and get trainers elsewhere,13 December 2021,GB
Kasey Britton,"Customer service is atrocious. When you pay for something on the website, it claims it's in stock, but when you try to pay, it fails and says there's no stock. Three days in a row, the same item. They can't even string a sentence together and cut you off when you contact them via chat.",13 December 2021,US
Sheryl Welch,"Never received sweatshirt.  So after a few phone calls, because the first person was rude as anything, I finally got another sent which I DIDN'T RECEIVE THAT EITHER., as it never changed status.

Dave lane,"Not sure anybody ever looks at reviews but as Nike aren't interested in talking to me here I am.Both my kids play football and with multiple sessions per week we go all out and buy the top of the range boots to keep their feet in good shape.Nike phantom vsn ghost boots at £240.Here I am in the 4 month of use and they are falling apart. Repaired each set of boots twice already. The sides of the boots torn on the instep on three out of the four shoes. Not for the first time either.My kids keep asking for them I keep buying them, then I keep repairing them with Nike not giving a damn.I may as well have MUG tattooed on my forehead.NIKE please please for £240 a pair improve the quality. You should be ashamed of yourselves.I have lots of good quality Nike products but with the money being spent here you should be ashamed of yourselves!Massively disappointed!!!",11 December 2021,GB
James Toole,Useless. Delivered to completely wrong part of the city now Nike claim it can take up to 9 working days for refund. Utter eejits.,11 December 2021,GB
MiKayla Penn,I ordered a pair of shoes. Was told free shipping on $75 or more and was still charged $20 in shipping. Once I received the shoes they were a little small. I called and was told I could take it to a Nike store for a full refund. Took it to the Nike outlets in Norfolk Va where they only gave me back $127 vs what I paid was $143. When I asked why it was less they said because I had them ordered. That is very frustrating and disappointing from a large big named company such as Nike. I will no longer be shopping with Nike anymore and will be going to other stores that actually honor their word!!!,10 December 2021,US
Alexander Callaghan,"Horrific customer services, Website broke says in stock but when your payment is going through it fails and tells you no stock. Same item three days running. Contacted them on chat and they can't even string a sentence together and cut you off.",10 December 2021,GB
Trae Browne,"I also had a pair of Nike Trainers again an air bubble popped so I contacted Nike, and got a very expensive £13 returns label emailed to me to post to Amsterdam when I live in the UK. Six weeks later and online chat after chat, and still no credit on the account for these faulty trainers claim, or return postage to Holland so I phoned and this latest guy even lied over the phone. Again wanted me to reply to one of his emails with proof of postage and said that I would have the refund today, then at the end of the call used the usual it will be escaled to management blah blah blah. Then he said that he never said that I would have the refund today, so I played him a recording of our phone call while his lying you know what was still on the line. Of course he decided to release the call after he actually thought that I was a liar, and didn't have a recording of his lying you know what. Anyway I'll give these lying lot until Friday, and then I'll just go through the small claims court to get my money back. Let's also see if Trading Standards want to get their hands dirty for a change, the two year warranty Nike are meant to offer must come from someone to be enforced.",08 December 2021,GB
Nad,I’m a Nike member and have been for 5 years. Yesterday I received a parcel and wasn’t complete. The advisors are sitting in another country and do not understand. I was told to wait 3-5 days as they need to investigate and check driver and depots but after a couple of hours was emailed to say no refund or resend of items. Today they sed wait again 2 days for escalation when I phoned in but again was emailed to say no refund immediately. They are stealing our money and we can’t speak to a manager or anyone that is British with good English. The funny thing was they told me to check with neighbours for a parcel when I told them I received a parcel but not all the items. I wonder why Cus they couldn’t understand plain English. They sed there  was no where to complain and no name of person making decisions because it was the system doing it.  When I asked them for a name of the person making decisions. Please go in store like jd etc. DO NOT ORDEE FROM NIKE. Please cancel ur membership. I will keep you updated to see if they do refund or re ship. At the moment my card has opens a dispute. Mrs Nadia keyani,08 December 2021,GB
Sally,I would have given no stars if I could! They are fast to send the item but very inefficient to provide a collection for return or to pay your actual return. I have had to make number of calls for either of the above services and finally they never acknowledged to have received my item which was collected by DPD.awful service and very unreliable. Never again!,08 December 2021,GB
Alexander Young,"So the order came through quickly, pleased with the packaging and speed of delivery. Trainers were too small to I sent them back. The trouble is, after a week of waiting after returning, I hear nothing from Nike. I call UK their customer service and was told to e-mail through proof of return postage which I did. Still I hear nothing. I ring up customer service today and the guy on the phone sounded miserable, felt like asking him questions was like pulling teeth. I don't understand how a company so big can have such awful customer service. Please Nike, pay your senior executives less and invest some of that money into a decent customer service proposition. Wish I had read the reviews before deciding to buy from Nike. I don't think I'll buy anything from them again.",08 December 2021,GB
YF J,"Returned two shoes for size exchange, both of them was received by Nike last Sat. But just one was declaim was returned even I have the proof of the delivery. The received one was been refunded (not exchanged) for no reason even they are still in stock. The customer service cannot provide any useful help at all! Avoid online shopping with Nike!!!",08 December 2021,GB
Alasdair,"I ordered shoes that had estimated delivery between 2-5 weeks. After 7 weeks I started enquiring with customer services about this and was given no real answer, just an email to say sorry for the delay. Another 2 weeks down the line I tried again, this time with confirmation of issues with their factory. I was paired with a person from customer services, who emailed me at least 3 times a week, the vast majority of the time with a duplicate email of the previous and no further information. 100 days after purchase, I was finally told I would receive some compensation for my issues, but no confirmation of what that would be. When the shoes did arrive (almost 5 months later), they were clearly around 3 shoes sizes too big and had to be returned. The compensation I received was an out-of-date 20% discount code. Overall appalling service and would not recommend using the nike by you service anytime soon.",08 December 2021,GB
Jack Broad,Under the manufacturer warranty I send my Nike air max 97 shoes back providing them with enough proof of purchase and it was sent back at my own expense which I was I told would be reimbursed but they have neither bothered to contact me about this claim as I have check tracking past couple of days and they didn’t even accept delivery !They were sent to the address they gave me over email so definitely correct place plus they were stuck in customs for several days as it’s a address in Amsterdam ! I contact Nike by the phone 2 says ago was told they don’t know anything about it but will do a follow up ! Well nothing has happened and. I one had called me and I’m now without my shoes £13.00 down and the customer service support is shocking they don’t know what’s going on ! Will be reporting this to either trading standards or the ceo of Nike !,08 December 2021,GB
Pd,"Worst customer support ever, since there is none. Still waiting on my order after 2 weeks.  Chat fails for my country and when I call the people they tell me an internal review will be needed which takes 7 days. I hear nothing back and when I ask for a supervisor that takes at least 2 days. Still waiting on that call as well.The support agents are typically at childrens creche facilities and can't do anything with the call they took since they don't have their laptop.   There is no escalation path, no email you can send.Seriously NIKE, your brand does not deserve exceptional service.  Right now you are offering no service. Where my shoes are I really don't know.....",08 December 2021,CH

Dillon Davis,"I've always enjoyed Nike products but ordered directly from their website for the first time last week. When my order shipped, I saw that it was going to be delivered by LaserShip. Having never heard of LaserShip, I had to do a quick Google search and oh boy, that raised the alarms. Countless awful--not bad, AWFUL-- reviews after customers had packages arrive weeks late, sometimes damaged, or for many of them, never received the package at all. Sure enough, my package was marked as ""out for delivery"" this morning at 9:30am. At 9:45pm this evening, I was informed the package was left at my door 10 minutes ago. There was nothing there, and I also have a Ring on my door, so it's an utter lie to say it was delivered. My options by a Nike customer service rep were to either issue a refund or receive half of my order because the other item is no longer available. No ""Hey, sorry about that, let us make this right"" or anything. Just a ""Let's roll the dice with LaserShip one more time or here's your money back."" Save yourself the nightmare, order from a website other than Nike. And NEVER order from a site that uses LaserShip.",07 December 2021,US
Mohamed Naffati,"This it's definitely the worst experience I had this year. I've ordered a PSG TRACKSUIT the 1st of November but before I order online I did ask in Nike shop how long it takes to get the item, they assured me that it takes around 3 to 5 working days.It was a birthday gifts to take it abroad. Today its the 6th of December and I haven't received anything yet not even a notification about it. I contacted the customer service online chat about it, ( good customer service no doubt) but I did wanted my money back they told me you will receive your money between 5 to 9 working days. The 5, 9 working days has passed and still no refund I called again the same thing happened I have to wait 5 to 9 working days. I told them I've waited before but nothing has changed, she told me that they haven't go a head with the refund.I hated my self for doing this. It's my worst experience ever. I looked like an idiot for not getting the birthday gift. And I have no bloody money.I'm going to go a head and I will take it to the press. I'm so Pi** OFF.",06 December 2021,GB

Mark Morrison,I bought a pair of shoes at the Nike outlet the pair of Nike air 270 .Really like the shoes had them for about 6 months the bubble burst . Causing the shoe to be somewhat like a flat tire .I sent them back to Nike because I lived over 200 miles from the outlet I bought them from .people suggested I send them back to Nike they told me they stand by their product well for me Nike choose  not to stand by their product .not only did they keep the shoes that I sent back but also refuse to send me another pair . Instead they offer me at 20% discount which I flat out refuse .very disappointed in Nike customer service and professionalism they don’t stand by their product .,03 December 2021,US
Anthony,"Unlike Adidas' website there is no automatic exchange facility if you want to exchange for another size.  You have to call Nike customer service, who seem slow and unsure about everything.  I called to request to return a size 7.5 and exchange it for size 7.  The lady seemed hesitatant and not very reassuring but she assured me a size 7 would be sent once the 7.5's had been received.  Today I had notification that the purchase price had been refunded to my card - no exchange!  To reorder a 7.5 would mean paying £60 more online as the price has shot up.  A further frustrating phone call to another uncertain lady told me the only way to resolve it was to reorder the 7.5 and pay the higher price.  And then once I received shipping notification to call again and ask the agent for a 25% discount!  I don't feel at all confident that would happen, given recent experiences!  She couldn't send me an email to confirm this arrangement, nor transfer me to a supervisor.  Really, really rubbish customer service with people who have no authority to help constructively.  A perfect case of ""Computer says no"".  Nike - you really need to up your game.",03 December 2021,GB
Mr impatient,Nike think it's ok to send a EU 2 pin plug to UK customers for there automax to charge. I though customer service would be good at Nike but it's totally the opposite.

Alex,Took a month now for Nike to sort out my Nike Claim enquiry. My air bubble popped and I’m trying to claim a refund but Nike are trying their absolute best to prolong the process.

Katherine Orozco,It's cyber Monday and I could not log into my Nike account nor could I add any products to my cart.  I contacted Nike customer service and they were absolutely no help.  This is not something that only happened cyber Monday - this is ALL THE TIME.  Nike's website platform SUCKS.

I made a purchase on Nov. 15th with a scheduled delivery date of Nov. 19th.  It is now the 29th and I still have no delivery.

Got the same pair for Christmas, and again rarely wore them. This time they lasted about 8 months. I have them in several colors, the black are the only ones I had that issue with. However, for the price none of them are comfortable. I rarely ever ware the others because I am afraid they will fall apart. Stay away from Nike. They are just not what they use to be. Go to adidas!

The online chat said call customer service and ""I guarantee they will sort it"".  Of course, the second call to customer service had the same response.

At the end of that 7 day process please allow a further 3-5 days for payment, this is a multi billion pound business dealing with a customer who only made the mistake of paying for something that never arrived, and wants a refund to buy gifts SHAME ON YOU NIKE",25 November 2021,GB

billy bubenick,"I purchased 2 pair of Nike's size 10 in 2019 the Nike vapor max and the air max 2018. The vapors were purchased at beaverton pro store at their plant the 2018 were purchased at the local outlet store. Within less that 3 weeks both right bladders deflated. I tried bringing them the the pro store , but just being a US Marine wasn't enough to get back in even though I showed their security I purchased them there. The answer I receiver was I don't have an ambassador not so ""get off the campus before I get arrested"" what a way to treat a military veteran.  I went to the outlet store with no help there either. I was told the manager was not on the premises and she would be the only one to be able to do this credit. I was asked to leave the shoes there and the manager would call me before 3 the next day. We'll that came and went I returned the following day and the manager was there and called me a liar stating her assistant manager I was to call before three. Needless to say I pulled my phone out and let her hear and watch the whole conversation.  I had the phone in my shirt pocket capturing the whole play by play lies they tried to push on me. The manager without any apology stated she sent them to corporate and it was on her. I called dozens of times and got the run around. Finally I get orders to go back to the middle east and call nike to let them know I would like and answer or resolution when I return in 6-10 months. I return with no return contact from Nike. No phone call , no e-mail and not mail. I call nike and I was told due to my lack of contact they didn't think I wanted to go any further. So nike let it go. I was then disconnected.  I called and I received an man and told him my story for about the 15th time and he said it will stop today. He stated he would credit me a nike gift card for the product the nike clearly dropped the ball on. And a 15% of the next purchase.  Well that didn't show. What did show was some fake/made up story about 3 shoes and there prices and the gave me have of what I paid. All three of the shoes they stated were less than half of what they sell in their stores. I want the credit for the two pair of shoes that I purchased for over 500$ and had them all of three three weeks and were taken from me with the understanding I would get a credit for the defective shoes. That never happened. As a US Marine and a veteran of this country I am appalled at how little Nike cares for their life long customers. CWO3 William BUSMC732-575-0713",24 November 2021,US

Its shocking a multinational corporation cannot fix a status order update on the website. I also noticed I have mulitple pairs of shoes which state ready for pick up after ordering them and collecting them months ago - clearly this is an issue which is not getting solved anytime soon.

Please continue to check your tracking for real time updatesNow what is my fault in both these I want to know that I am being subject to such humiliation.

I did not find this out until 11/11/21 and I spent over 6 hours being passed from pillar to post getting conflicting information! I made several complaints and was told that a manager would call back in 48 hours which of course didn’t happen. I then called again and had the phone dropped on me twice. I then called again to complain about the terrible communication issues and conflicting information I have been given.I called in the next day as for a 2nd time I did not receive the manager callback!At this point I was furious as it has cost me more to contact Nike than I am getting as a refund and it is becoming very stressful and distressing.After 6 days I receive an email from a manager Eric who had NO empathy and kept talking over me as I explained the situation. I cannot believe the fact that I STILL HAVENT RECIEVED MY REFUND AND IVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND MINEY TRYING TO GET IT BACK!I am extremely disgusted and feel very undervalued by Nike.I hope someone can take REAL ownership and resolve my issue!

George Kenna,"I bought a pair of Nike Air Monarchs July 17, 2021. I paid $85 for them. This is November 2021 and already noticed the sole is coming off on both sneakers. I tried using super type glue to keep them together but I'm pretty disgusted that they barely lasted 4 months and it's actually less than that because I went on vacation for 3 weeks and used hiking boots and not the sneakers. I would love to be able to post some pictures.",16 November 2021,US
Beca T,"If I could rate 0 I would. How can one of the biggest companies have the most ridiculous processes. I ordered a pair of trainers that never showed up, I had to chase and they then told me they had gone missing. So I reordered and waited a week. They then arrived and already had stitching coming apart. They wouldn’t let me return in store so I had to then had to post them back. I then receive no refund so chased again. I wanted to re order the item & they told me a gift card would be ready to use within 24 hours, ok great. Of course this wasn’t the case. So I had to then chase (again!) and they told me it would be another 5-9 days until my gift card was refunded. How?! How can it take 5-9 for credit to be put on a gift card when I store it’s done within seconds? I’ve now been 3 weeks waiting for these trainers. When I asked if I could speak with someone senior they just cut me off the chat. Absolute shambles. Moral of the story Don’t order from nike.",16 November 2021,GB
Saffii Phillips,"Placed an order online for NikeID at the end of September for a Christmas present. I understand that these orders take a number of weeks to be produced and shipped, however I received an email on the 2nd November to tell me that the order had been shipped. I have been tracking this and there has been no update on the shipping since the 9th November. All the tracking says is that there is a delay and my order is in Germany. I have contacted Nike customer services to try to get an update, but the only response I get is 'As far as we can see the order is shipped, you need to contact the courier yourself'. I have contacted the courier, but had no response and there still isn't an update on when my order will be delivered.I work in sales and customer service myself and I completely understand that due to Covid and Brexit there have been numerous delays on shipping, however I would appreciate it if the company I purchased my order from would be more willing to help chase the order, as I fear this will get lost with the lead up to Christmas and there being a lot more parcels in the system. I ordered this back in September to try to avoid the Christmas rush in the hope that I would receive the order in plently of time, but I fear that if this is lost and I need to reorder I won't receive the order until after Christmas as the website states the production time of these orders can be anything between 4 and 6 weeks.",15 November 2021,GB

Nicole Burns,"Wish i had read the reviews before buying.  It says on the site, free return shipping.  When I brought my package to UPS they charged me $14.93 to ship.  I contacted Nike Chat and asked what the deal is since I read that I would get free return shipping.  Well apparently you have to join and be a memeber in order to get the free return and i ordered as a guest.  nothing they could do.  Would not budge.  Offered me a 15% promotional code for my next pair.  I declined as after this experience I'm quite positive there will be no next purchase.  Shame on Nike.",06 November 2021,US
RICHARD GOOD,"Nike again accusing me of lying to them.I returned 2 pairs of trainers and a top in the original box that Nike delivered to me. I received a refund for the trainers but not the top.I contacted Nike who asked for proof of posted which I emailed to the on 19th August. Ewelina told me it would be escalated to the senior team and the escalation would usually take 3-5 business days. On the 31st August I had to contact Nike as they hadn't contacted me. Bola told me 'After thorough investigation by our senior team, our senior team confirmed that this last items was not received at the warehouse. On this occasion, a refund will not be issued'.I told Bola I wanted to raise a complaint and was told'I will be sure to pass your feedback to our senior team and the case will be dealt with internally'I asked if the would reply this time as they didn't last time? Bola did not replyI contacted Nike again on 1st September and was told by Jake'The correct teams have investigated your cases regarding the issues mentioned. Again on this occasion no refund will be issued to you and the decision has been made by senior staff and is final'. I asked who I could escalate my complaint to and was told by Jake 'this case is out of our hands, that's the senior teams decision and we don't have control to change their decision'.I then got the same response from Luiz, who spoke to his supervisor and again the decision is final but i could raise my complaint with an online dispute platform.I got the same response from Ellie on 3rd Nov however she went further and told me'Please note that the tee was not lost in the warehouse but simply not returned to us in the parcel' basically calling me a liar! (also Elie clearly hadn't checked as she kept referring to the Tee when I returned a long sleeve jumper!)I would advise all customers to avoid Nike online if you are not 100% certain your are keeping the item. As they have the right to claim you did not return an item, call you a liar and keep your money. If you question them, their senior team will decide it was not returned. The don't even have a sufficient level of customer service to contact you to tell you their decision you have to chase them. But as long as they get the money....***Update***I raised my complaint through the online complaint resolution that Nike said I had to use and not surprisingly 30 days later Nike didn’t even respond so the case was closed. Pretty much sums up the lack of respect Nike have for their customers. Would be more surprised if they had actually resolved the issue.",04 November 2021,GB
Melinda Maclean,"I bought a pair of sneakers Nike air max 270.   I only ever walked in them cause I have a bad knee and the material on the bottom wore through and the bubble is busted on the right and the left is about to go.   I sent them back to Nike and they said IT WAS NOT A MATERIAL MALFUNCTION in reality the material wore down and it is the material as I should get more then 4-5 months out of them.  Not only did they ghost me online, they actually sent my non functioning shoes back to me-such a low move and very nice of them to pour salt on the wound.  Did not offer anything, not even a 10% discount towards a new pair but I got my non functioning pair.

Now, it won't be delivered and I have to wait until they receive the return to get refunded for money I paid for products that didn't get to me BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOMPETENCE.

When I opened the box there was no trainers inside. Nikes response was there are not going to provide a refund as it’s says a different shoe size on the box. When I explain this is the box I received they said no refund will be provided and processed to ending the call. I want a refund now,24 October 2021,GB
Adam Lawes,"Their app is terrible. I placed an order, paying using PayPal. The money was allocated pending the order being processed by Nike but after checking in the app to see if my order registered, I was told that I hadn't placed any orders with Nike yet. After nearly an hour, I checked again. Still no order in my history and the $150 pending allocation. So I placed another order to try and use the $150 withdrawn from my PayPal account, only to find they withdrew another $150. I then called their ""customer service"" line to be told that only one order could be cancelled as the other was older than 30 minutes, the salt in the wound was that the refund would take up to 5 days to be credited. They're great at taking your $$$ but so damn slow to refund it. I'll never buy from Nike again. Arrogant attitude and crappy app technology. Zero stars would be more fitting for these jokers.",23 October 2021,AU

Boots took over 6 weeks to finally arrive and I was given 3 delivery dates which came and went. After one hour of use the boots were showing signs of the printed parts wearing off. I was told to send them back and wait another 7 weeks for replacements. Absolute joke considering how fast kids grow out of boots and they expect me to wait a total of 3.5 months.

Out for delivery at 2:48pm and delivered to the front door at 2:49 pm. Nothing delivered to our apartment. Called LaserShip and couldn’t understand half of what rep said.

No other outlet of opportunity, can’t email anyone, submit photos etc.Complained (via chat) about a very expensive pair of trainers belonging to my husband, where the heel literally burst within a year of use and the response was: basically: hard luck, nothing we will do, along with ‘Is there anything Else I can help you with?’ … and then immediately Cut off!!Thaaaaaaaanks Nike. Left with useless trainers and hole in wallet. Lesson learned. Let’s ..NOT…do it.Always happy to be contacted by them to prove I’m wrong.",12 October 2021,GB
Alice maskrey,"Ordered a pair of trainers, they weren't delivered on the scheduled day, reported it to delivery company who said it was Nike I needed to get I'm touch with.

Last collection they literally had fur in the shoe (air max), now it’s all Nike Air Force Pixar although well designed (not for real wear, as I’ve worn mine for two weeks in hospo and they have holes in), which is why I don’t think they are as fun and hard core as they were 2+ years ago. The colours are great but the wear is just so mediocre. I will always love Nike but hate how faddy they’ve become. I literally have all the knit airs in my hallway to remind me how much I loved them, and they all lasted two plus years of love. Now Nikes have no structure and make your legs ache.

Nike would have to make their own investigations and I would be contacted within 5 to 7 business days. 16 days later still no word from Nike. I have to call them again only to be told my parcel is missing (surprise!) and that they would send me an email regarding the refund. They could not resend the order as the items were out of stock.

MR Neil Hobday,This company is getting worse by the day. Had to send back 3 pairs and now I’m going to have to send back 2 of the replacement pairs due to poor quality.

Anna Blasco,I’m having the worst customer service experience with Nike Spain. On Aug 20 I returned and requested a change of size  of a pair of sneaker I had bought online. The new pair never arrived. I contacted numerous times customer services and each time I was told the warehouse was going to send the sneaker that week. Nothing arrived. After 6 weeks I was told by a customer service agent that it was better if I cancelled the order as the warehouse was never going to send the new pair. So I cancelled the order expecting the refund of that 97 euros I had already paid. 3 weeks later and the refund hasn’t arrived. I’ve already called 3 times customer service and each time I’m being told a different story. So it seems Nike has an issue with its order system and it appears there’s nothing pending to be refunded to me. So 9 weeks after I requested a change of size I have 97 euros less and no sneakers. Im hoping at some point this will be resolved but after this experience I’m not going to buy from Nike again.,05 October 2021,ES

Arvanti Pitt,Never buy from them EVER again. They don’t help their customers at all. The work with a company FedEx that takes your shoes and then lie and don’t ship them. Nike still use them instead of going elsewhere to make customers happy. Why sell stuff when it doesn’t get delivered in a timely manner. They don’t resolve any issues at all. They try to lie to get you off the phone. They will take your money but won’t fix the issue. Customer service is terrible I feel sorry for people when Christmas comes if they using FedEx. You’ll NEVER get your package. I spend a lot of money with them well I DID with them but not anymore. I see why some of your stores are closing down. SMH!!!

She was NOhelp and refused to allow me to speak with a Manager. The should have MAILED it, or make an exception and send it pre-paid.

Al,"Ordered shoes online via Nike website. They said delivery would be no longer than 2 weeks. Got an email saying that they would be a week late which was fine. On that 3rd week shoes were on their way. Waited for them, they never came. Checked the tracking over the weekend - tracking said “returned to sender”. Called the company in charge of the delivery, they said that the number of my house was not on the address label. Called Nike to sort it out. They said they would, no changes were made on the tracking, waited a week, still nothing, no updates from Nike either. Called Nike back, they said they emailed the company in charge of delivery and haven’t received a response. I asked them to call the company. They blamed the pandemic for the delay in delivery. I have received multiple packages on time through the same postal company, so it’s obviously Nikes fault that my package hadn’t been sorted out. Still nothing had changed after another week of waiting. Called to get a full refund as I have already waited nearly 7 weeks. Won’t be ordering via their website again",27 September 2021,AU

PAUL DUBROW,I bought 3 pairs of nike sneakers.  They are less than 3 years old. They do not use a good bond glue!  I put the cement and silicone all of them. All of them peel off 3 different layers.  I called Nike and they said do I have receipts within 3 years. I do not keep receipts since. I attached pictures (unable to picture file attaches) You can see I put the cement and glue but fall off different layers.,24 September 2021,US
Tim Lam,"Ordered a a number of items from nike, which was delivered to the wrong address on the first instance, and took two days trying to get through to customer servicesAsked for them to resend it and was told I would have to re-order so they refunded, which took a week to show in my account, however i re-ordered immediately as I needed the items.The second time around the parcel arrived empty, so called customer service again and waited for an hour to get through and informed them that for the second time I had not received the items and that I wanted the items, however was offered a refund.Asked them to just send the items that I paid for and was informed that the items are no longer in stock and so they can refund but not much else they can do.Wasted my time ordering on numerous occasions and having to call customer service multiple times.Save your time and buy from Reebok instead.",24 September 2021,GB
Mike,"Still not received my order - delayed for over 10 days now with no communication. I called up at Nike say there's another lengthy process to be gone thorough with their courier Hermes.

WOW…My order was placed on July 9th…it’s now almost 3 months and still have not gotten them…but the latest deliver date they told me today is November 22…5 months.

Daniel Cliffe,"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered some custom Nike By You Air Force 1s on July 12th. Says it takes 2-3 weeks to deliver, 4 weeks passed and nothing. Contacted Nike and not one single person has any idea where they were, was just told they’ll be a delay and will contact me when they know anything. Another 2 weeks had passed to be told they will be delivered on 21st September! Like what the hell? That’s more than 2 months wait. I argued my case and asked for compensation which they offered me a measly 20% discount code (something you get as a member quite regularly). I contacted them a week or so after to confirm the order was still going to be delivered on the 21st to then be told the 29th September. This is now beyond a joke, no1 has any idea why or where they are. I sent a final email asking for another update a few days ago to get the response that it’s now going to be 14th October!! That’s over 3 months to deliver a pair of trainers. What a bloody joke! I just cancelled it and am now waiting for my refund to clear I just got fed up with it as I’m obviously never going to receive what I paid for. I will never buy from Nike ever again purely down to this awful service and the fact no-one has any clue what has happened to my order! DO NOT ORDER FROM NIKE!!!!!!!",18 September 2021,GB

Demetrius Barnes,"3 times this this month i have had orders say they are on the truck out for delivery only to have the package delayed another week. How are my packages on the truck out for delivery then end up going backwards, towards the originally shipping facility? Customer service actually lied to me once and said the product was out of stock so it never shipped so I ordered the same product from another site, only to have the shoes from here come a week later. This is in acceptable from a company as big as NIKE. maybe they need to switch shipping carriers. I need answers cuz now i fully expect my packaged to have issues coming from nike. Sign that i need to nop shop here anymore (online) due to incompetence",17 September 2021,US
Sarah,Don’t not use!! I ordered a customised shirt for my son using his 8th birthday money. Told to wait up to 5 weeks for delivery. Due today and had not arrived called and order had been lost and no one at Nike can tell me when the paid for shirt will arrive… apparently there are no supervisors to speak to when you call customer services! Absolutely appalling service whilst they’ve sat with £70 of my child’s money for 5 weeks and the call handler says all I can suggest is you wait another week and SEE if it arrives!!,17 September 2021,GB
M A,"I ordered a pair of trainers from Nike who have always used DPD as their courier. In 10+ years I’ve never had a problem but this time I got an email saying Hermes would be delivering my order. The email said they would deliver between 4pm and 6pm. At 6pm I got an email saying the delivery time had been changed to between 6pm and 8pm. At 6:08pm I got and email saying my parcel had been ‘successfully’ delivered to a neighbour. There was no information about what neighbour my parcel had been left with. This was accompanied by a very badly blurred picture of a box, an open front door and a headless torso in a doorway. I contacted Nike and the customer service agent was very friendly. He said I would have to wait a few days for Nike to contact Hermes to investigate where my parcel is. So I’m now £150 out of pocket and don’t know where or who my trainers where delivered too. This could all have been avoided if Nike had used DPD instead of Hermes the worse parcel courier in the UK.I’m already getting fed up of having to return orders to Nike because of the bad quality of their trainers. I’ve been buying Nike trainers for over 20 years and the quality has really deteriorated in the last few years. There’s also the constant price increases every year. A pair of Nike TN’s that cost £110 back in 2003 and where good quality now cost £155 and fall apart within 3 months. The bad quality, yearly price increases and now Nike using Hermes as a courier have put me off ordering from then again. So beware if you’re in the UK, Nike use Hermes as one of their couriers now so you might not receive your order.",17 September 2021,GB

Mr Kevin O'Donnell,"Processed the same transaction for one order twice. Did not send bank authorization for the second transaction. Contacted customer service and was told I would have the send the item back, can't recall and can't refund despite error being at their end, which they acknowledged as being the case. Was told matter was being escalated and I would be contacted. One week later no follow up, contacted again and had to explain all over again, this time I was told a courier would be sent to pick up the item. Then the agent told me they can't actually do that after all, and then abruptly ended the chat rather than deal with the problem. Gave up at that point. Long story short if you like Nike products don't buy direct, awful service.",16 September 2021,IE

Susan Dixon,"If I could give a zero I would.  Placed an order for my son’s 24th birthday.  Ordered 4 weeks in advance as it would normally never take more than 2 weeks to deliver based on all other orders placed previously.  Nike has now lost both products and is refusing to refund my money as their offshore customer service teams they have to first get confirmation the product is lost.  I called the carrier myself and FedEx said they have never received the package and have had no updates from Nike since September 2nd.  So how is it Nike’s massive Supply Chain doesn’t know this????  So I asked to speak to a supervisor and like many other comments on here, a supervisor is never available and I will get a call back in 24 hours.  I’m now calling their head quarters to get the refund processed or contacting my bank to put an investigation in to get my money back.

Crystal Garcia,"On July 1st I ordered two pairs of cleats for my son. It is his first year playing college football. He spent his own money from his grad party a total of $298. It is 09/14/2021 and we have no cleats and no answers. I have called over 20 times, I try to chat online at least once a week and they say I must call. When I call no supervisors are ever available the reps do not speak clear English and all they tell me is my case has been escalated and a supervisor will contact me tomorrow I have heard that for 2 months and not once has a supervisor contacted me. I have tried to cancel my order and obtain a refund they stated I can not due to the order being placed. I am so out done with Nike to have an athlete that receives a scholarship to play college ball and he can't even get the cleats he PAID for and no answers as to where they are or when he will receive them is absolutely obscured. To be such a large company and to just take away from a college athlete is just mind blowing NEVER will myself nor any of my patients order from nike.com again!

To start with, they don’t even look new & considering I designed them & they were being made to order, they should be immaculate! The leather is scuffed & marked & there is surplus glue all over them, there is also marks on the sole. The stitching & general craftsmanship is awful! Customer services are very unhelpful & take no responsibility or care over the situation! We are being treated appallingly, do not waste your money!

Dunc T,Got to be one of the worst sites to purchase Nike products. New releases are placed in somewhat a draw instead of normal sites with first come first serve. Attempted to purchase a product on release and logged in and on the dot to only being notified 15mins later it has been unsuccessful. There is NO LIMIT allocated to purchasing which makes some collectors purchase the whole products and resell them on the various sites. VERY PATHETIC!,11 September 2021,AU

Eliza,"My one star is generous to say the least. I joined Nike and became a member and was told upon joining that each member gets a 25% discount during their birthday month. Firstly this is miscommunicated as it only apply a to certain items. Anyway I tried to place an order via app… rejected. Tried 3 different payments…. Rejected. So I tweet about Nike and receive a reply I am advised by a rep to call up and order via phone the next day. First rep fobs me off saying I’m locked out of my account allow 48 hours and retry. Which I did still cannot purchase. So I call again the lady says that there’s an issue with my account and they will escalate issue to IT please allow 3-5 days. I allow a week nothing. I call again the lady takes my card details and says yep order has gone through and I’m delighted as it was the last day of the month. So I then wait and wait and wait no delivery. Call Nike worries as I’ve had no confirmation apart from verbal and I have given my bank details…. 50 mins later they establish they wasn’t ordered I have now missed out on my discount and they have advised if I ever want to shop with Nike I need to purchase in store. For a multi million world wide company I think they are appalling. They lie to get you off the phone, they are unhelpful and I am so disappointed. It’s clear their customers are nothing but a number to them.",08 September 2021,GB

Jamie,"After looking everywhere in Calgary for a pair of all black Nike Air Max 90's, my only option was to order them from Nike directly. As per usual, it took quite some time to get them as they came from the US but that was to be expected. When I got them I was actually kinda shocked at how much the quality has gone down in Nike shoes. It's very obvious they are made in a factory with poorly paid workers who don't care ( I don't blame them ). Glue is very obvious and noticeable throughout the entire outside of the shoe, something I expect from brands like Sketchers but for some reason had higher expectations for Nike. It's not worth it to send things back to the US after the shipping cost so I have no choice but to keep them, however I don't know if I would purchase Nike again based on how these look and feel. Maybe if they cut the prices in half to better in line with the quality of shoes they are producing. It would also be nice if Nike put out some women's shoes that were actually aimed at females ie cute colours!!! Put out a Lilac Air Max 90 and people would go crazy, so tired of red, dark green or gold as the only options for personalizing shoes. Girls like cute colours Nike, get on board! Very disappointed all the way around.",08 September 2021,CA
Susana,"They should change the logo to ""Just Fail it""....and fail it again.We all love Nike shoes but there were 2 consecutive times that they lost my order. They confirmed it, charged it and sent the e-mail with delivery status but after the delivery date past, they didn´t inform anything else. Then, we should call to the customer services several times, speak in english and with a terrible telephone connection we understood that the courier lost the parcel and that they will refund the money, they refunded the money but we cannot buy it anymore. The shoes were for my son's birthday, he is really upset because the shoes are sold out, no available anywhere.I strongly not recommend buy Nike on line until they improve the customer service.",07 September 2021,PT

Called third time, they said warehouse is closed until October 18th, no eta on shipment until they reopen. Asked for refund, denied. Went up further, again, “refund denied due to status of order”. Called to speak to the supervisor. Supervisor is never available and will always call back within 24 hours. Several attempts, never a call back. So, the cleats my son ordered for football season, which has now already started, is in the warehouse collecting dust until football season is over and is no longer needed.

Sometimes it's good to accept that you have messed up.I planned on keeping the shoes however now I will return ALL of them and move away to a competitor who to the least respect their customers.Your customer care executive has reached a conclusion in less than 2 mins and seems to understand everything regarding the situation, however clearly that's not the case.Thanks for providing nice footwear all their years, however, you will now not see a penny from my side.The missing SHOES cost is £44.",06 September 2021,GB

Very (nicely) surprised that it would come from such a large company as Nike. I ordered some trainers like I have done many times from Nike. They were realtively cheap and came with free delivery so already a winner, however, after a week of usage the trainers were not to the standard I would have hoped. As I had thrown away the box, the return slip and used them a few times I would assume that Nike would say a refund was not possible. I jumped on to the chat function was put through to a rep straight away, the dude replied immediately, told me 'he had my back' which was cool. He sent me a new return slip, told me it was cool to return in any box and that i would get a full refund. I have to say awesome service and how it should be for this sort of company. Kudos.

If they actually explained what happened (not just - it's Covid, because come on we have lived with that for more than a year now), I think I would be less frustrated with the waiting time.

Seasons have changed, weather have changed (who am I kidding, I live in California), anyway, this is not good customer service.

No updates received. Went on Nike chat 3 times 2 x told nothing they could do as they couldn’t see problem either !! But they would personally take it over and find us an update. Nothing received. Step sons birthday came and went and we had a broken hearted ridiculed little boy as he had told all his friends his “ special boots with his name on were coming “ today I got somehow on the UK chat to be told all orders were put on hold because of a safety breach. The breach was now sorted and they were just waiting for the orders to restart. However they couldn’t tell me if hat would be days, weeks, months or years. Hey are still allowing orders and taking peoples money we checked. Mean while our 10 year old will be grown with w full beard by the time these bloody boots arrive. They offered me 20% compensation discount off my next purchase!! Not a chance will I be buying from Nike UK ( or in fact any Nike) again. Disgusting from a multimillion pound company, bit looking at the reviews here looks like we are not the only ones. Seems Nike doesn’t give a crap !!",24 August 2021,GB

This system is hopeless. Very disappointing and will never order again from Nike.",23 August 2021,AU
Achim,"The Nike Group has no obvious way to manage return due to bad quality. All has to go through phone calls and live chat - and no tracking - no active feedback - no status update. And even after weeks and phone wise confirmed return arrived - still no decision, no feedback, no cash back - not even a coupon for such bad service. Terrible for such a company.",23 August 2021,US

NR,NIKE  company is great con artists.. They say the sneakers release on this date gets people to sign up for the membership and the  sneakers it only releases on the app so u has to download for the app and give your credit a card info. Then when the sneakers day arrive u have join a draw gives you credit card info and the security code and when you're done and enter the draw at the time they say to . It tells they will. Say you didn't make it ......what a bull but the sneakers that SUPPOSEDLY were only releasing that day are  online sell were before the release date .....NIKE Promotes PRICES GOUGING.,13 August 2021,US
Jean guirand,"I’m really disappointed with the way NIKE Sneakers app run their release and raffles. It’s extremely impossible for real customers to purchase a pair of sneakers without going through a pointless drawing system only to lose out to not users and resellers.

I returned shoes and after 10 business days reached out, because I had noticed I was not refunded, despite the shoes being marked as ‘return complete’ It took me DAYS to get someone to call me after they promised 24 hours and never called. I spent hours on the chat and calling and they still never answered why they tried to steal my money and were very dismissive.

Now 9th of August, I still haven’t received any emails regarding the delivery, I call the customer service again, and was told that my order was processed in error. I could not believe it.

I received a call from the person who received the package.  When I called to ask Nike to correct it, they blamed this mistake on me stating that I placed the order to this address that I’ve never even been aware of.  They refused to send me the sneakers to the correct address where I asked them to shipped.  When I asked to speak to a supervisor, she spoke over me and told me that I was lying and I ordered incorrectly.  It was truly shocking.  Knowing that these sneakers were shipped to Bayonne, NJ and my billing and shipping are not in Bayonne and I didn’t indicate Bayonne on my order, one would think Nike would save themselves a bad review and loss of a customer by sending a new pair to the correct address.  It’s baffling.",07 August 2021,US

No help what so ever from customer service other than return for a new pair, well the last couple pair after wearing for a lengthy time does same but never in the beginning, My initial feedback is to let Nike know about my concern but now after 4 times and no emails or call backs obviously with no results. I told my husband I wear never buy him another pair of Nike even though he loves the look of it, squeak or no squeak, if I can’t even receive a courtesy call back.

PL,"I was looking for a new pair of Free RN but couldn't find them anywhere (stores and online). Every retailer I visited said the same thing: We think they've been discontinued but we don't know for sure. Nike never tell us anything. So I tried the support chat on nike.com (available on US site only). Whoever I was typing with found a pair of Free RN but when he/she realized I'm not in the US he/she told me they couldn't help me. I asked if the Free RN had been discontinued and got the reply they don't have any information about that. So I then asked them what else they got with a drop of 5mm or less (low drop - similar to the Free RN-series) and guess what. They could not help me! ""I can't find anything"" the person said and asked me to call the number on my local Nike site (not US).So I did. That number was reconnected to somewhere far away from my country but once both me and the woman on the other end got used to the muffled connection we slowly started to make a sort of interaction in English - not native to either of us. After about 10 minutes we concluded that she didn't know the answer and couldn't find a shoe with a smaller drop than 9mm (which is a large drop). She suggested I should probably look at another brand and that was it. How the hell can a company be so indifferent to it's customers and it's own staff? I mean, the complaints is not about their products. It's about the behavior. I have never ever heard retailers shade a brand like this before. One of the larger ones actually told me: Nike don't care about us one bit.I loved the Free RN series and was really looking forward to buying another pair, but I have to say, this realization has put me off Nike altogether. I just can't understand how you could justify this ""business culture"" as a company.In the end I bought a pair of Saucony Kinvara 12, which isn't exactly like the Free RN but amazing nevertheless. Also, everyone I talked to knew everything about Saucony and said they were great to deal with. I'm good now but it does feel weird that Nike actually left me and not the other way around. So.. F you too, Nike.",16 July 2021,SE
Mark Spencer,Nike working in collaboration with pro direct are absolutely shocking at dealing with refunds both of their  processes  sre extremely poor to say the least communication is rubbish,16 July 2021,GB
Fiona E,"I used to really rate Nike, largely because they offer a great & easy, free returns process, which meant I could order two sizes and not worry about needless hassle and expense returning the one I didn’t want, which other companies have. However, having run into problems that are clearly the fault of DPD courier, my opinion of Nike’s customer service has fallen significantly. Their processes in the case of an indisputable error on the part of the courier (I have photographic evidence) leave the customer caught up in the problems having to wait while Nike and the courier sort it out between them, all the while having paid for goods they haven’t received. This does not happen with other companies who ensure the customer receives their missing items and then they sort out where the problem lay without further inconvenience to the customer. Sadly, therefore, I would be cautious about recommending Nike and, having used them a huge amount over the years, am much less likely to do so again.",16 July 2021,GB

Eli Easy,The absolute worse customer service  I've ever experienced in the last 30yrs and for Nike to be a multi billion company you would think the customer service would be the best of the best. I returned a defective pair of Nike that cost $220 plus tax. I had to pay the shipping cost for the return. I was given a voucher for $220 buy not for the tax i paid nor the shipping cost. I called them 3 days in a row attempting to place a order with the voucher that i still haven't received only to be put on hold for a total of 2+ hrs with all the time from all 3 calls added together.

So I have to call when I want to place an order, and then deal with someone who barely speaks my language. Placed an order last week, gentleman said he would tie it to my email address and gave me the order #. For days I've tried to get tracking info and it doesn't recognize my email with that order number. I called twice this morning but couldn't get past automation since he didn't get my email right; so I move to chat. They ask a ridiculous amount of questions and tell me no supervisor available. They direct me to call the 800# which I advise I've already done twice and both times disconnected me because I couldn't provide the email the gentleman entered. It's like a maze with Nike these last two years and so disappointing from a brand I love so much. I simply need to stop shopping direct with them and buy my Nikes from other retailers.

KimF,"I’ve just been assisted by Grace from the Nike customer service through chat and she was very helpful and friendly! I told her I’d give her a good review but there was no option to do that after we ended the chat so I’m posting here instead. Thank you, Grace, for being helpful, warm, and polite! I hope you have good days on the job and that you don’t get rude customers ❤️",05 July 2021,PH
Hidden Findings,"I have made several purchases from nike.com, and with each one, I needed to return items, and each time, they failed to refund my money. Even after contacting them several times on each occasion, they told me to expect the refunds, but continued NOT to refund me.On one occasion when using their online chat function, they cut me off three times, so I was forced to repeat myself each time. And on the last occasion, they also cut me off. They clearly have no interest in serving those customers that they have let down the most.On the most recent order, they were out of stock of one item and sent me an e-mail, informing me of the lack of stock and the fact that I would soon be refunded. However, they NEVER refunded me, and even after contacting them 3 times over a 2 month period, they still failed to refund me. Even worse, this time, they told me that they could not refund me, as I had paid with PayPal and that I should contact them instead. And let me be clear... these refunds totalled several hundred pounds - if I hadn't noticed that they were missing, I'd have lost it all.Despite my love of Nike design and clothing, I will never buy anything from this awful online service ever again! If you do, you risk throwing your money away. Do so at your own risk!",05 July 2021,GB
David Ho,Disgusted with Nike uk ordered some custom 97’s and the sole had been stuck on sideways with glue marks over them when bearing in mind these trainers cost extra than In the shop because it’s supposed to be “better quality” it’s not I waited a month for these to come just to be dissapointed and when I contact them and show them picture evidence they tell me to send them back and get a refund as the only option I have or to basically deal with it but what they don’t realise is I don’t pay all that money and wait all that time to just be like oh let me return them as soon as they come they should give my half my money back for ruining half my trainers but no all full of non serious jokes.,05 July 2021,GB

Carnel Haynie Jr,Have a pair of Black Air Jordan 12's. I walked in them a handful of times since the purchase so the shoes look fairly new. I played basketball in them and my first game my sole game off and I almost rolled my ankle. I was just told because I purchased my shoes two years ago nothing can be done. What a cheap shoe. This reminds me of the Zion Williams shoe blow out incident. I've been purchasing Nike Air Jordans Since 1993 and will never spend another dime of my money on their products. Over the years the shoes have been made cheaper and cheaper and they fall apart. Nike have became more quantity or quality.,02 July 2021,US

ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN) THEY PROCEED TO OFFER ME A REFUND AND TELL ME THEY'LL SEND A RETURN FOR THE TODDLER SIZE I NEVER ORDERED...

Andrew Whitehead,"A brand like Nike you would expect top notch customer service. My Autistic son had a pair of VapourMax Flyknits which he  saved up and was so proud to own. One of the air pockets defeated, so I called Nike and they suggested I returned them due to them being less than a year old. I sent photos prior to sending as Nike requested a photo to confirm the item. So far it’s been nearly 5 weeks,  I’ve called a dozen times to be told numerous things. First they wanted proof of postage I sent that, which they then said it was incorrect, after four additional calls later  they told me they had misplaced the shoes , but we’re now in a position to process a refund because the escalations team had confused the returns receipt with another item. So you would hope finally I would be sent a refund and in a position to order my son a replacement pair. Nope...! Firstly  they told me the refund was going to be credited to my PayPal, nothing. So I called again a week later to be told they need my international banking code, so I spend  the best part of that evening on the phone with my bank to obtain it. Then when I called back and told the advisor I was calling with my banking information, I was told they hadn’t even processed it and wanted the postage receipt again. One week later and after it’s been escalated 5, yes 5 times they inform me today the item isn’t a Nike product. Which I brought from Nike,com and have the email receipt for them, I asked for a explanation on what that meant and basically was told they are fake, even though they I had purchased from Nike . So  please read this before you take for granted the company today we all love for awesome footwear, they sell fakes to us. Try telling your distressed Autistic son that. Nike you are a complete joke and when,  and I say when I receive my sons shoes back, which I’m skeptical that I will, I’m taking this further.",01 July 2021,GB
Mr Posch,"Shopping experience is fine, product arrived quickly, returns seem designed to frustrate. The only offer free returns if you set up a nike account, even when the return is due to their mistake. I chose the free return option of dropping it off at the Nike store because using their store finder for returns I saw there’s one near my office. On arrival, I’m told they can’t do the return because it’s a franchise store. So I’m back returning by Mail. We’ll see how that goes but not happy that I’ll lose the shipping charges on their mistake. Ans of course they don’t claim the business on trustpilot so they can ignore the complaints.",01 July 2021,AT

Anita,"So after years of good experience just happened to be scammed by Nike! I ordered something but I had to return it. The tracking site shows that they have received so I contacted them to ask about my refund. They said they're not able to locate my parcel on the depot so I have to wait another 5-8 days while they investigate my parcel's whereabouts. After a few days I asked again when can I expect my refund but an another ""agent"" remind me the investigation could takes 3-5 days. So probably they're know different policy but that's alright. Today I received an email which is mentioned they cannot locate my return so they're not gonna refund me. I mean... WHAT?! There is a proof of shipping and receiving. It's not my business if they got lost my parcel after they received. So I contacted them again on the live chat and they confirmed what I received via email. They're not able to locate my return. They haven't received anything. So question 1 is that: Why the tracking site shows they're received. I've been told there was nothing in the box. Wait, what?! So they cannot locate my parcels or was it empty?! While I asked the costumer service kindly switch off the chat on me and I ended up with a ""you've got all of the information"". The costumer service is unbelievably useless and lying then the best solution what they can produce is to switch off the live chat. Well done!",23 June 2021,GB
Nurse FABULOUS,"I have been buying and wearing Nike for over twenty years. Nike has always been my #1 go-to brand for all my athletic wear, from shoes to running bras, shorts and pants.Recently, I ordered over $900 worth of Nike athletic wear. It was either too big or too small and ALL had to be returned. I spent 2 hours and twenty five minutes on the phone with five different customer service representatives and NOT ONE could return my order! Not one! They were very nice but totally incompetent at their job online to return my order. I asked the last representative for the return address and I will pay for the return myself. Unbelievable! Thank you, Lululemon, for being so much better and costumer-service friendly so that I can shop at Lululemon and never again at Nike. Nike, you have a problem. A BIG problem!",22 June 2021,US
SEE IT T.V,Nike doesn't value consumers like they say they do.

Anonymous,The worst online shopping experience I had thus far. Don't waste your time here. Extremely unprofessional staff and slow response. My order got canceled because they couldn't verify my payment. I was using PayPal to pay for my order. The reason I am using PayPal is that they provide a secure and convenient platform and they protect the buyer. I believe this is a human error from Nike or eShopWorld.,17 June 2021,AU

Instead of the shoes arriving I recieved two sweaters. I let Nike know and they said that they couldn't do anything unless I returned them items back. I don't have a vehicle and I was very upset that I had to make ammends to a mistake that they made.

Paul Warhurst,"I placed an order twice as it said that my order could not be processed when I pressed to pay and that an item was no longer in stock. Therefore, I believed that the orders had not gone through when in fact they had and this was not made clear in any way. Once I realised what had happened, I could not even cancel the duplicate order as the button to cancel the order was not there even though it had only been 1 hour. I was not able to contact customer service as it was after 8pm and the lines were closed so I had no other option than to email them. I woke up to find that the long, detailed email that I wrote out had been a total waste of time as it was completely ignored and the only email I had received in response were informing that both orders had been dispatched! So basically, I paid for the same tracksuit twice and will now have to wait until my order comes, go through the long returns process getting it ready to send back, waiting and worrying while it is in transit, waiting some more for my return to be processed and for the money to finally appear in my account  all because of an error in your website!

Carolyn Flynn,Horrible customer service when you have a problem and just want to let management know. Plus they use lasership for shipment and your packages just end up not being delivered. It’s hard enough to get a sneakers app win and then to have lasership steal them 4 times in a row. And then to have Nike not do anything about it. Just sorry here’s your refund for the shoe you can’t get anymore. Good luck paying resale for it.,08 June 2021,US

By 10pm local time, I contacted a Nike webchat agent, and I was then told my order are not ready yet, and he has no visibility when it would be ready. He said he would escalate the matter and monitor mymy order for me (to which he didn’t), I had no choice but to wait.Thereafter,  I had to contact Nike a few more times who all promised to get back to me BUT NEVER DID.

Danielle Hitchen,I made a large online order from Nike over 10 days ago. It was due to be delivered 5 days ago but nothing arrived. The tracking number supplied for dpd continuely says they haven't received the parcel. Contacted online chat and spoke to Jorilyn who assured me the parcel would be there within a few days. Another 5 days later and still no order and Jorilyn refusing to reply to any emails that is sent. I have now sent 4 emails without getting any reply. Tried the online chat again and spoke to Gil who informed me that no other agent could tell me anything because it was being handled by Jorilyn. Explained how shockingly bad their colleague has been only be be fobbed off again that they would escalate it and have the said colleague contact me with an update...... still waiting!! I will now have to push a charge back with the bank and contact trading standards because this is absolutely appalling from a company of this calibre. Would never order from Nike again and would suggest anyone else think carefully before parting with your hard earned money to this company!!!,06 June 2021,GB

I order men sizes because Nike does not carry a 12 in ladies.  I also order a half size larger for swelling during my daily power walks.  This sneaker is like walking in a high heel because it causes your feet to roll forward and blisters the achilles.  I had to stop my walk and call for a car to pick me up because the blisters became unbearable!  I'm sure had I worn the sneakers upon purchase, and contacted Nike, they would have exchanged or refunded.

Kohn Dykes,If I can give a negative review on this I will. I know some will agree most won’t. But have you tried asking Nike if they have a complaints system? Was very surprised to learned that complaints don’t exist in this company. No wonder they can do whatever they want and some customer rep not all are liars and rude. The first one I’ve heard that complaints are not allowed cause they don’t have such procedure or policy. Cheers to that,01 June 2021,GB
Tomek Wagner,"I bought a pair of Nike Air Zoom Vomero 14 running shoes on their website for £83 ( they were on offer from a retail price of £119 ) back on September 28th 2020. Shoes were comfortable and great for running. I'd use them 2-3 days a week for running ( between 5 -10km ) . After 3 months, the back inside padding ""pillow"" above the heel started coming off, next month a hole where big toe is appeared in one of the shoes, then padding on the second shoe came off as well, this time making the shoe almost impossible to run in due to discomfort caused. I tried complaining to their customer service, but literally got ignored... They asked me to send photos after which I have never heard back. I contacted them to verify if they received them. Now I'm actually quoting what I've been told that they did receive the photos and ""higher team"" will review the them and get in touch. If you pay so much money for a pair of shoes you don't even use that often, you'd expect them to last more than 6 months! It's that simple.  I have contacted them to see if they were willing to do something regarding this experience. Genuinely any sort response would have been better than just ignoring a complaint of customer providing a genuine feedback on a poor product. Meant to buy another pair of shoes from them, but no thanks! I will get myself ASICS instead just as I used to before trying out Nike.",01 June 2021,GB

What more could you want?I returned an item from my order today and Madhuri and Jamie from the customer care team on the Nike App were so helpful!Issued a refund straight away for the item I returned and mind you, it was my first time returning an item! It came up on my PayPal account as I paid through paypal. Hands down one of the best experiences of my online retail and would highly recommend to anyone to shop online at Nike!",27 May 2021,IE
Sean,Falsely advertising 30% OFF EVERYTHING when indeed it is not 30% off everything. It even says (full price items) which is also not the case as it has a number of items full price it does not included when you try and purchase the item. Trading standards needs to get involved here i think!!!,27 May 2021,GB

Mike Davidson,This is about how Nike uses political campaigns to boost profits! Best example is Colin Kaeperbick and BLMTrashy ugly shoes made by southeast asian children   When will people stop buying their garbage? Their shoes are always too tight Air cushioning pops easily They suck!

Buss,"Sadley I have changed my mind re the Nike customer service, May last year I gave it 5 stars, May this year I find myself giving it a 1 one as I cannot leave 0. Waited for a football kit to be delivered, received socks & shorts but no top, now over a week later and on the day the top was meant to be delivered I receve an email saying its been delayed and I cannot cancel the order until the order is at least 10 days late, RUBBISH service.I even called them the day before the delivery to chase as I had not heard, and they said it could still be dispatched and delivered today, but nothing apart from an email at 8.22am saying its been delayed :(still no update from Nike as of May 27th 2021, SO POOR",25 May 2021,GB

DoubleD,"I bought a pair of Kyrie Flytrap 4's in a 9.5UK, it fits beautifully length ways but the width is so tight it started causing a bunion, which annoyed me enough to go and look at their sizing chart. According to the chart, a 27cm foot needs a size 8 UK... lol The 9.5 UK is perfect in length but super narrow for my feet, how can the size 8UK be the right size for a person with a 27cm foot. I would understand if I bought the wrong size but according to Nike I should've bought a smaller size. Super annoying to have spent so much on poor quality and then only to find out that they dont understand how measurements work. Nike, bro, measurements are constant, people's feet aren't. Just because Kyrie Irving has weird banana shaped feet doesnt mean you can pass it off as a bigger size. Fix your damm chart and label your shoes correctly. I feel like you owe me a new pair of kicks even though Im not asking for it.",24 May 2021,ZA

Qasim Rabbani,Went into jd bought £70 pants. Was expensive for me but I liked the fit. But just after a couple of weeks stitching came undone and colour started fading. I looked after them but felt cheated. Also bought trainers and they ripped very fast. :(,23 May 2021,GB
Cher,I made a large order with Nike and unfortunately the stuff did not fit. I sent back everything together in 2 separate boxes. I got a refund on some of the items but not all when I called up to say what was going as it’s been 2 months they claimed they did not receive some of the items and one of the boxes was empty when they eventually said they had located it now this was after a further 1 month. I sent proof of postage so they know I had returned the stuff and they keep telling me they can only refund me for the items they can locate as a customer that is not my problem that you can’t find stuff in the warehouse as far as I’m concerned I sent back every single item that was in my order and the funny thing is they refunded some of the stuff that was in the same box as the other stuff they claimed was empty.now why would send back an empty box? And when I have emailed I get no reply it has now been on going for a total of 5 months and I can not get no answers or no refund. I will NEVER order from Nike again. As big company like Nike I expect better customer service.,23 May 2021,GB
Gracia Rweyikiza,"I ordered a customised trainer. UPS driver left a delivery note for me to collect at a nearby collection point.  Went there 5 days in row no item, phoned Nike customer services struggled to speak English, didn't not know what they were saying eventually told me the parcel is in some shop in Northampton, England! I live in Milton Keynes! How did my parcel end up in Northampton? UPS Said they will redeliver  I told them I was working away im not home this week to deliver at my local premier AAA shop (which Nike has used before to deliver my stuff)  Nike called to say it was going to be delivered yesterday I went there still no parcel. Decided to drive to Northampton cheaney drive where UPS said it was taken in the beginning, Nothing was there. My conclusion driver stole my item, as now Nike claim they will refund my money.  I designed the trainers with my son for his birthday present. How is this even fair its not about the money my son wanted this special customised trainers! Horrible company and Horrible dodge UPS driver!",22 May 2021,GB
Lindy,I ordered $300 worth of clothes on 4/26. Delivery quoted 5/7. On 5/14 FedEx said package received empty. Nike told me they will put a trace on. Can't do anything until they hear from FedEx. 5/21 I'm still waiting for Nike to get back to me.  FedEx told me it was empty in 5 minutes... Nike needs more than a week to get the same information? They just don't care about customers. Disgraceful.,21 May 2021,CA
Resha Resha,"Approximately two weeks ago I ordered a pair of Nike leggings.  I consider the delivery to be very quick.  I was able to check my delivery at all times.  However, when the package arrived it was delivered to my neighbor.  I think that was very unprofessional, I almost didn't receive my package.  I decided to track my order once more; and of course it states that the package was delivered. Yes, it was delivered, but to the wrong person, and for that reason I am highly disappointed 😞",21 May 2021,CA

Adnan,Ridiculous company if im honest. Ordered a pair of shoes which I requested to be taken to a collection point (Which I use all the time as being a doctor I'm not home most working hours) however the courier decided to take them back to the warehouse at nike and issue a refund? No threat i can reorder them cant i? NOPE they were a limited item and wont restock on their site. No threat they can get them resent out to me and i can make a manual payment for them? NOPE they cant do this either. Okay what about sending me a alternative replacement? Nope cant do this either? Asked for a call back from a manager and all i got was a email saying heres 20% off your next order? This company literally thinks they can do whatever they want. I wouldnt be surprised if the management have taken the shoes that have been resent and gave them to one of their kids (which we all know they have done before and said kids have profitted quite nicely from this premium service)If i could give this company 0 stars i would but the worse i can do is 1 so will have to do i guess. Doubt they will ever read this as their management team probably too busy making profit off reselling shoes and partying with celebs to be concerned with normal people.,20 May 2021,GB

Jay,"Ordered a birthday gift for my boyfriend, estimated delivery was undetermined but no biggie. Then the package is stuck in Red Deer for a week. I then message Nike assist and they say that my package is lost. Ridiculous that they didn’t even notify me of that. They refund me after 3 days and I get a 20% off code. Then I make a new order of different items with my promo code. Again, waited 2 weeks, no estimated delivery date. Messaged Nike assist again and they “investigate” the order and find out, surprise surprise, the package can’t be processed. Again, didn’t notify me until I reached out and same thing happened twice in a row. Promo codes don’t fix my wasted time, money, and overall awful company standards. I’m done ordering from Nike. Billion dollar company, do better.",20 May 2021,CA

One I am told has been damaged and they have charged me for but are unable to give any expected delivery or return date at all. The third they have also charged me for but say is out of stock and should be shipped within the next month if possible. Customer service can give me no dates at all.

I mentioned this to customer services and was told a replacement would be sent once I post back the smaller ones. I was told not to use the return labels that arrived with the original package and to use the ones customer services emailed me. I did the return as per their instruction. A week later I was told the replacement was cancelled. 3 weeks later and I have not received a refund. They can’t seem to find the return. They have refunded me 1p for some reason. I keep being told it’s been escalated and senior team will contact me but I have no faith. I am now out of pocket, no trainers for my daughter. Expected so much more from Nike but really they seem useless and have zero customer service.",17 May 2021,GB
Michal,"I would expect something better from Nike. Multibillion dollar company can't make their website right and is cancelling orders a few hours later without any reason why... Explanation from the support: my card details or billing address is incorrect. Card details incorrect wouldn't even let me pay through the order and I triple-checked billing address. Support is just repeating that some details might be incorrect. I used two different cards which always work on other websites, but somehow Nike is the only retailer that is cancelling orders because something doesn't match. It's not the first problem with their security practices, I had similar experience in the past. I totally understand caring about the security and I know it's hard to make it right, but Nike's approach is just really bad and not at all customer friendly. The outcome: I just can't make an order no matter how I try.",17 May 2021,GB

Terence McClunie,"I am giving Nike a one star review because I am so tired of every time I go to order a pair of shoes or clothing it is out of stock. today was the launch of a new pair of shoes that I’ve been waiting for a week and a half to get for my daughter‘s 14th birthday. literally one minute after the shoes dropped they were sold out of the size I needed. I called customer service and he said the shoe sold out in 19 seconds I am a Nike club member and can never get the shoes I want when I want them. what are the perks to being a Nike member?I don’t get how shoes and clothing stay out of stock for months sometimes a whole year. I am confused as to why if they see that their stuff is selling out so fast do they not make more. I mean come on it’s Nike. what, are they only making 10 pair of shoes for the launch. I’m really debating switching to a different brand and find me a new app where items are in stock on a regular basis. Also Nike never sends any kind of coupons, discounts opportunities or anything to its members to be able to use for future purchases. nflshop.com sends you a 20% off coupon every time you buy something from them. I feel like as much money as Nike makes they should be able to take care of their members a little better and do a better job of keeping items in stock on the app.  I have a list of items that I loved and saved and when I go and look at it 85% of it is out of stock. Totally unacceptable. I am Very very very unhappy with Nike!",13 May 2021,US

local reviewer,"To begin with, it is impossible to find a shoe in stock on the Nike website. What’s the point in launching new models if it’s not on your own website but on footlocker or dodgy websites online? This isnt even for one specific model so I liked 4 different models from the AirMax series in plain black nothing special and they were not available on the web only rarely at footlocker (and that company is rubbish online too). THEN I found a similar model the AirMax plus 3 in black only with blue laces so I thought don’t be picky it’s fine. Added it to Cart filled all info and it kept saying “error” etc and just didn’t put the order through despite me trying more than once with different cards. So I said leave this and went to Adidas online and bought myself shoes from their today which has already been shipped. Disgusting stock, ALSO glitchy website, and orders don’t go through. I’d rather pay less at Adidas for better quality and fast service, not once have they done this. So off putting.",11 May 2021,GB
Martin,"It slightly hurts I have to give Nike.com a star, because I truly believe they deserve zero taking my latest experience into consideration, and I hope nobody (!) experience anything similar at any big company in the future.I actually really likes the brand in every way, and have always done. I also believe there is all capabilities to create the best experience for the customer, both in stores and online, with some great store and online setups visually.With that said, I am deeply sad about my latest experience, which have been devastating for our relationship in the future.I created an order Thursday 6th of May 2021, in the morning at 7.20 (1,5 hours before Nike.com call center opens), and after trying several times without any success with the final steps on creating an order, finally the system accepted my credit card and I receive an order confirmation.At 7.22, two minutes after my order confirmation, I received another order confirmation, out of nowhere, on my email account.I called customer service at the minute they opened, and the assistant I spoke with, promised my to sort it out, without creating any challenges for me, and I thought the case was closed. I actually went out of the conversation with a great feeling of getting a proper customer service.The following day I realize the two orders was ready for shipment. I was, of course, extremely surprised and frustrated I had to use more of my precious time to sort something out that was not my mistake, but decided to call again, to ensure the system-made extra order was cancelled, and the assistant I spoke with promised me to sort it out, and created a refund to go back to my account after 5 business days.Today, 3 business after latest chat with your CS department, I received the order I ordered, but then received emails stating I should have received both orders. I then called again, for the third time, and the assistant I spoke with this time told me:- An orders cannot be cancelled 15 minutes after the creation (but again... I did not create the extra order)- The refund was never created Friday. It would first happen once the product was returned to the warehouse (but I should never have left, since I spoke with you 1,5 hours after your mistake happened), and from this day it would take 5-9 business days (depending on my bank) for the refund to take place- She would start an investigation to find out where the ""missing"" product were (and I had to provide a massive amount of information, that would not have been necessary if the system worked as it should)- She would call me back with an answer after 2-3 business days.I am sitting back, as a customer in your business with a lot of frustration and questions:Why do your assistant(s) provide me a lot of falls information, because everybody says something different vs the prior person I spoke with?Why promise something you cannot live up to? If you are unable to provide a simply service for a mistake you and your system has done, then be honest, at least.Why do I need to call you this many times to sort out something an issue you have created for me?How come can it be me that has to prove something, with an order I have done everything in my power, to help you sort out? When will I get my money back?I am sitting back, as a customer with the feeling that I have done something wrong, especially when needing to deal with assistants who meets me with equal frustration/anger and does not believe a word I say, despite this is something you also state in your customer service call intro you seem to have experiencing beforehand.One thing, I will promise you: I will never shop with you on your website again. And unlike you, I will keep my promise! Despite being a big fan and impressed about your efficiency with the order, especially taking into consideration that it was customized, I really think I have used too much time and energy on this issue.I hope to hear from you!KRMartin Markvardsen",11 May 2021,DK

My shipment location was the Nike warehouse in Memphis, TN -- read so many complaints about this location and ""lost packages"". I do not understand how Nike is not on top of this given so many complaints. I also do not understand why they tape up the boxes with ""Just do it"" labels to let people know they are Nike products!

Patrick Skater,"I have an incomplete spinal cord injury and I have difficulty completing tasks that rely on my hands. I was looking for sneakers I can put on independently. I like to go for a good long walk using my Rollator walker and I need a quality shoe. I also prefer to be more stylish so I’m not interested in the usual Velcro options offered for folks like me. Luckily, NIKE has the new Flyease line. I tried several sizes and models before finding a perfect fit in the Nike air zoom Pegasus 38 model. The Nike representatives were awesome in helping me figure out what would work and the return policy made it quick and easy, not to mention cost free, to try out different shoes. I also enjoy the dry fit line of clothing. It’s perfect for Arizona weather.

sunny,"1st ever order with Nike, never again!!!! 1st order came here damaged, so i thought i was missing something, then contact you directly explaining my order then was advised that it was only a hoodie i ordered.....but i said that how come it was listed under ""tracksuit set"", no explanation was given, and i was cut off!!!! totally rubbish customer service, misleading advertisement.......one disappointed kid (only got hoodie but no bottoms....how am i going to explain to the little one????)",01 May 2021,GB
Piss Off Nike,"Nike's customer service is terrible. I have been promised time and again that Nike will reach out to me about product vouchers that I had used over the phone but the order was never delivered. No one has contacted me and when I call I am connected with people that can hardly speak English so it goes nowhere, just the promise of an email or phone call in the next couple of days. I also recently ordered cleats with a week of lead time to make sure I received them when needed. After several days I noticed the order had not shipped so I contacted them via chat. The rep assured me that they would still arrive as scheduled. I checked again the next day and they still had not shipped (the day that they were due to deliver). I contacted them again and they said ""too bad, we don't know when they will ship. CORONAVIRUS."" No help, no solutions, just the ocassional ""I'm so sorry, that must be frustrating."" I've had bad experiences with businesses before but this is the first review that I have ever written and probably the last because I will never do business with Nike again. Terrible terrible terrible customer service. I will actively discourage others from buying their products too.",30 April 2021,US
V L,Nike is absolute garbage! You cannot find size 13m in anything good! All shoes 13 and over are trash! When retro shoes come out you have no chance of buying them and then they double in price from 3rd parties. Overpriced. I'm sure bots buy them or people who know people get them. How is it that only famous people get them. I'm burning all my Nikes and jordans and let's all get back to Adidas!!!,29 April 2021,US
Martin B,"Had a few issues with orders in the past but generally OK.  Placed an order C00574954116 with them on 8 April and heard nothing for 4 or 5 days.  Then an ""sorry item delayed, we'll be in touch"" email.  Nothing for another week and used Nike chat - got the usual ""we love you"" messages but chat person couldn't say what was happening or why.  Promised to send me daily updates but never heard a peep.  Tried chat again today and the same - no idea why after 18 days it was delayed or any likely resolution.  Had a rant  and asked for a refund - what annoyed me most was the chat person was just clicking automated responses such as ""we're sincerely sorry"" and ""thanks for using Nike"".  Anyway will see if I get a refund or have to file a Paypal claim.  Been a big 20 year plus customer but plenty of other options out there now than Nike so its a goodbye from me.",27 April 2021,GB

Karen Haughton,"I bought a pair of F1's last year, they have hardly been worn when I discover the inside heel has worn down and a sharp prong is protruding. Very dangerous and could cause harm. Tried to make a complaint direct to Nike and requested an email via the online chat. I was told they do not have any contact details to complain? The adviser called Shiela turned off the chat before I had chance to finish my conversation, very rude. Avoid these trainers especially for children - they are dangerous!",26 April 2021,GB
Luke zona,If you want products to arrive in good condition... Nike is not the place. Paid £150 for some shoes for the box to come battered to bits. They had packaged them in a box triple the size of the actual shoe box. The shoe box inside had moved around so much the box turned up at unsatisfactory level. Such a shame I’m having to write this review for such a well known business. However looking their past reviews I’ll be thinking twice before buying again,25 April 2021,GB
Preston,If they still support Lebron after what he’s doing I will no longer purchase nothing by Nike.,25 April 2021,US
Pam,"So disappointed. I never get a chance to get any trainers I’ve like on SNKRs. Like someone said earlier, the Jordan 5 toro bravo was meant to be a regular drop - then it’s a raffle :/ it’s such a shame that resellers get all the stock and real customers are left with nothing",24 April 2021,GB

Nancie Fontaine,"We purchased a pair of Nike running shoe for our 8 year old (Junior 3 5-7 Air Force 1). After 3 weeks they started falling a part and the stitching is unraveling. We contacted customer service and after talking to two individuals, they send me a shipping address which I will need to pay myself.   We sent them a bunch of pictures of the shoe but that is not enough.This process will take at least 5 weeks they explained and if they can send us a new pair.  So basically 6-7 weeks with no shoes  with the unknown if we even qualify for a replacement pair. We are very disappointed that they would not pay for the return shipment and taking all this time to return an item. So if it’s not, I guess they ship your old shoes back? I will no longer be purchasing anything for Nike.Poor customer service, bad quality shoe, poor workmanship.",22 April 2021,CA

Glenn,Yet another greedy American company!! I notice NBA jerseys are going up each year...what a surprise!!!..now between £90-£125 for a swingman replica?? That's disgusting and then these muppets at nike wonder why people buy fake stuff.  Can you blame them??? They even exploit labour workers in China and Indonesia who work in shocking conditions. Without morals. Karma will come around....,20 April 2021,GB
AlwaysfortheTruth,"I'll get straight to it. Nike has unbelievably bad customer service, extremely slow shipping, and sky high prices. I made the mistake to go through Nike.com for my next pair of shoes where I've used finishline.com in the past. I finally find a pair of shoes in my size that look good and they want $160 (Yes, that's just for one pair.) So seeing as how I qualify for free shipping and have already spent a small fortune, I may as well take advantage of it. NIKE didnt even send my shoes until 3 days AFTER they were supposed to have arrived on my doorstep (mind you, the free shipping was already going to take 2 entire weeks). So now it's been 3 weeks and still no product, just customer service telling me that they know I'm anxious for my shoes, but I have to remain patient. FIRST AND LAST TIME CUSTOMER.",20 April 2021,US

Diana,"Hate Nike!!!! More than 5 (!!!) orders in a row were cancelled, no matter what payment method - I've tried them all by the way. No reason for cancellation, ""contact your payment provider"", well I've contacted all my banks, paypal and gift voucher provider and they had no issues to process all the other transactions I've made the very same day. I would give up months ago as anyway lots of people saying that Nike's quality now is a joke - leggins could be thrown away just after couple of the weeks, it's not the same qulity it was 5 years ago. Unfortunately, I've purchased gift voucher which is obviously unrefundable and Nike doesn't let me to spend it cancelling ALL my orders! Customer service is absolutely useless, they ""open a case"" for you and say ""they will contact you with an update"" which never happens (as you could probably guessed already). Avoid at all costs!

Janet Trombetta,Don’t count on Nike to get your item on time even if you pay extra to get it there. I paid for the two day service so I would have the item on time to go to birthday party with gift in hand. Well that didn’t happen. Now I have to tell the host I will have to give them an IOU. How embarrassing!!  I asked what compensation do I get so I can run to the nearest store and buy something else to bring ( even a gift card for another Nike product) I got sorry Miss my supervisor said no. “ It’s not our policy to compensate for untimely delivery even if you pay extra”,16 April 2021,US

Brian West,"Just spent an hour dealing with customer service, I don't blame the customer service agent or supervisor for the inadequate return policies and online scam ordering system because the lower level people are a veil to keep the people making the programs and systems untouchable just like every other bad online ordering system out there that screws people over. If it wasn't for a long history of wearing Nike basketball shoes and having a difficult time finding my size instore- I would NEVER order from the online website.Nike sent and charged me for the same order twice and at first they didn't want to give me a refund until they receive there extra pair of shoes back that I never ordered in the first place. I argued to get the refund back because I work on a budget and can't have people overcharging for ish then tell me when then can and can't return funds because of their bullish policy. They basically stole from me in the first place and now holding money that doesn't belong to them. So now I have to wait 5-7 business days to receive a refund-way too long also, and on top of that I will be charged again if they don't get their extra shoes back in the next two weeks-how am I supposed to know they'll get there shoes back in time if they cant even catch mistakes in their ordering systems? If a company makes a mistake like this, especially one as global as Nike, they should eat it plain and simple, I don't believe in policies unless they relate to peoples circumstances and show that a company owns its mistakes.5 minus stars",15 April 2021,US
Gillian23,"I have no idea where all the rubbish reviews are coming from although they all sound suspiciously the same. The website is brilliant, excellent sale price for my trainers. Goods dispatched as promised the day after ordering. Already have the tracking. If nothing now goes wrong it will have been one of the smoothest shopping experiences I have had outside of Amazon prime. If anything does go wrong I will update. I am just glad I ordered before I saw these shocking reviews. Are they for real???? I am within the UK.So, a few days later: Trainers arrive via DPD our best UK courier, full tracking provided and actually earlier than estimated, and the trainers are exactly as described and expected and even more comfortable/better quality than I could have hoped.

Alexa Guilliot,"2021 - I ordered a pair of shoes online and paid extra for quicker shipping.  The shipping was not only late, but it took longer to ship than what it would have at the regular shipping price.  The shoes not only did not fit, even though they were the correct size, they also felt cheap and like the soles were made of plastic.  I immediately requested a refund.  They sent an email with a ""shipping label"", but because I do not have a Nike account, I had to also pay for one at FedEx.  Also, UPS, Nike's suggested carrier, would not ship my nike refund.  I had to find a FedEx location to do so.  7 days pass and I see that my order has arrived at their facility.  I have received no email saying they've received the shoes and no estimate of the amount of time it would take to refund my order.  I called customer service and had to dispute that they did in fact receive the shoes when they tried to claim otherwise.  I got verbal confirmation that my refund would take 21+ days and that an email was sent.  Have yet to receive an email.  I don't expect service like this from my local stores much less a multi-billion dollar company.  Support nike at your own risk!",12 April 2021,US
Ang,"I ordered three items for my sister's birthday. It came with only two items--a hoodie was missing. When I contacted customer service, they said they had to investigate the carrier, in other words ""It's not our fault, it's the carrier's fault!"" Disgusting behavior for a huge company to push the blame onto an innocent driver. Couriers are working hard enough as is and I know for a fact my regular DPD driver has always handled my deliveries carefully and respectfully. The other two items didn't fit my sister well and in any case we were so repulsed by Nike's blaming of the delivery driver that we decided to return them. Tracking showed that my returns were delivered on April 9, but I received not even a confirmation email, much less a refund. I contacted customer service again and they said they had no record of receiving it. So...are we going to blame the delivery person again when there is clear tracking with technology? They are now asking me to send them a receipt of my posting the return, which I am about to do. They will also be receiving a screenshot of this review in the email.

Craig,"Well where do I start?  I've been trying to place an order for over a week and can only conclude Nike do not need my business!I initially placed quite a large order for shorts, trainers and a tracksuit and was given an error message of 98D2586B. I tried again later thinking it was a one off glitch but I got the same error.I called the Customer Services number and was told that it could be worth deleting cookies and cache data from my laptop and try placing the order again. Didn’t work!I called again and explained that their solution didn’t work and this time another advisor said this message relates to a problem with the payment because the shipping address and billing address were different. I thought this would be quite a common thing with orders being placed, but I tried his suggestion of changing both addresses to my old address and then I should call customer services to change the shipping address. No joy, same error message. I was also advised to try paying with a different card. Same error!So I called them again and tried to place the order over the telephone. I was on the call for nearly 30 minutes providing all of the item codes and colours/sizes etc. I gave my card details and was told it would not go through. Same error! At this point I was told to wait 24 hours for it to clear and try placing the order again.I waited 24 hours and got the same error again. I called again and they apologised for the issues and said I should go through my order again. Another 30 minutes, and another error message! She said she would refer it now to their Payments team.I waited three days and no call from their Payments team as promised. So I called up for a fifth time. The guy then says I would need to call my bank to confirm that they weren’t putting the stop on the payments. I told them I had already wasted about two hours trying to place this order, with two separate cards and I’m not going to call the banks. The cards are working fine and this was their issue. He said the Payments team would not look in to it unless I called my banks. At this stage I was extremely annoyed and told them what a waste of space they are!So now I’ve given up with Nike. Clearly they do not need the business and aren’t interested in resolving an issue that clearly lies with them and their systems!Don’t waste your time people – look elsewhere!",31 March 2021,GB

I sent them back to Nikeand they were quick to tell me they were rejecting the claim because the hole was due to normal wear and tear.  Wait, what???I have sneakers which were worn much more often with no tear, yet they are in pristine condition.  How they came to that conclusion I’ll never know.

Everyone else complains about everything in this life now days with the new WOKE and everyone made to apologise for even BREATHING. by the way #STOPMALEHATE (nothing wrong with a little male masculinity) Will Nike and Lil nas x's be apologising for this? Seems not (And do not tell me Nike had no idea because product detailing would have been spoken about from the design, to the colour, the stitching and advertisement and sales pitch.Nike clearly knew) Lil nas has issued a reply via a music video sexually, giving the devil a lap dance.

Brian Gutierrez,"i literally spend thousands of dollars a year on nike shoes, and apparel. I have literally been a walking billboard for them. I was extremely disappointed on my last transaction. I tried to purchase two pair of shoes from the NIKE web site. I was ok with waiting a week to receive them but then the days came and went . I contacted customer service and explained my concern about not receiving the products on the promised date. I was expecting oh no worries it will be there or sorry its late. When i got "" It hasnt left here yet"" that was a little bothersome. During the chat i felt like the customer service rep had dismissed the whole thing and me as a customer. i asked what could be done and was told nothing for now lets just wait and see if they show up tonight. they just told me it hadn't shipped how on earth could i get it tonight. Unless somehow they have Santa's sleigh and reindeer. so i said well i guess we should cancel. She was way to quick to pull that trigger and the order was cancelled and she was on her way. Well Brittani i am guessing you are getting a lump of coal this year. NIKE is this your idea of how to treat a loyal customer if so i guess i will be changing brands.

Chris,"Finally hit a jordan 3 release on the snkrs app and was charged and provided a tracking number. A few days later called UPS for shipment update and they tell me the package was never received. I call nike customer service and they guarantee me the tracking will update later in the week.so a week goes by and i contact nike again and there answer is the package is lost we can refund your money. Mistakes like this should not happen especially with the many failed attempts at getting a sneaker and when you finally ""get one"" they lose your package. Wasted my time in the snkrs app, but now i am done with nike for good.",27 March 2021,US

Felicita Lozada,"I ordered a pair of Nike airforce for my disabled son and they were supposed to arrived 3/25 thru FedEx on his birthday, but they never arrived! Even though I received the email that package was delivered. So I immediately called Nike and reported the fact that NOTHING was actually delivered (me desperate for my son's BD present) customer service tells me that they were delivered to the wrong address so I went to the address and it was an empty lot so o called FedEx Office and now they tell me the driver dropped off the 📦at another address (3rd address) where the 3rd address came from? 🤷‍♀️ all I know is that Nike and FedEx ruined my son's birthday. Thank you Nike and FedEx for ruining my son's birthday day. 3/27th AND I STILL DONT HAVE MY PACKAGE!!! I want to thank customer service Elsy who was very compassionate and understanding.",27 March 2021,US
Joseph Serpico,We placed a order to be customized for our local soccer team. The order shipped late and came in the wrong color and defective. Unfortunately we did not have time to complete the lengthy return process per the Nike representative request due to receiving merchandise late and we were in need of the merchandise before the next sporting event so we were forced to use damaged merchandise. We had offered a compromise for Nike to offer some type of discount on our next order to make things right. The Nike representative offered NOTHING and also refused to allow us to speak to any other Nike representative to better help to come to some type of resolution. I was very disappointed that our trust in Nike had been broken and we will no longer be a Nike family.,27 March 2021,US
DARWIN TROUPE,"If I could put a negative 5 I would. Your Snkrs App still doesn’t have ‘ I’m not a bot’ verification process. So that leads me to believe you are in bed with the resale websites. I remember when you could order a pair of shoes and not have to worry about getting scoped by one person with multiple bots in play. A lot of less appealing sites have the counter measure against bots. But Nike has not made the necessary upgrade to the system to slow down the price gouging from the aftermarket sites. I’m sneaker head tried and true. I’m not in for the resale, I buy shoes now because when I was a kid my parents could afford Nikes for 3 boys & a girl. But no worries, your losing more old head consumers then you think. But I’m sure with resale money getting funneled back to Nike you will continue to stay deep in the black.",27 March 2021,US
Asher Dust,"I ordered two pairs of Nike trainers as a gift. Order processed fine. A few days later I received an email to say that my order had been cancelled. Reason given, insufficient funds, as well as other reasons eg, customer error etc. This is a total fabrication. I had more than enough funds, I also double checked my details when I entered them. Furthermore I had purchased several items online from other places. If Nike had sold out, at least admit it, then move on. I double checked my bank, as well as sufficient funds, there was no notification from Nike!!I absolutely have no interest in dealing with them again. Lesson learned.",27 March 2021,GB
Terra  Palmer,I had an issue with an order I placed. No I didn’t get out come that I wanted but the customer service from Abbie was fantastic. Extremely polite and as helpful as she could be.

Still waiting for a refund after 5 weeks. After many phone calls and web chats they keep coming out with excuse after excuse. It will take a while to check we received your shoes....will you send proof of purchase....not, not that one, another proof of purchase.....when did you send your shoes.....oh, we have them, your claim is being assessed.....your claim is being escalated to the senior team.....oh, did we say it was being escalated to the senior team, well it is now.....

BC,Bought two pair of Nike Monarch shoes.  One pair the right shoe sounded like it was designed with a toddler squeaker built-it and the skin started to peel after less than 6 months use.  Now my second pair is starting to do the same.  I sent in one pair for the Nike warranty and they denied the claim.  What a waste of time and money and now I learned after denying the claim they destroy the shoes rather than return them to the customer.  These will definitely be my last pair of Nike shoes.,21 March 2021,MY
Vicky,Purchase regularly from Nike.comMy most recent purchase was 5 pairs of Air Max for me and 1 pair as a gift. So that I did not have to wait on delivery they sent the items in 3 orders so i got them sooner.The pair that was a gift was too small which was unusual as a size ten usually always fit. I wanted to exchange but they did not have the same ones in Stock. I returned for refund which was done quickly no problem at all.Bonus 2 days after refund they were back in stock and 10.5 ordered.Will continue to order,21 March 2021,GB

Nike made my order so complicated. The shoes's been sitting at the Post Office for more than 10 days and nike asked me to pick it up. Why?!My job is to pay the bill, Nike's job is to give my shoes AT HOME. It's that simple. It should be as easy as ordering a pizza.",21 March 2021,AU

Vera Katic,"I have ordered Nike running shoes on their official website. I received no confirmation email whatsoever! I also tried to change the address because it was written that the shoes will arrive on March 23th and via dpd. And dpd just leaves packages with who ever is in the building. I though I have managed to change the address via chat (the woman was very nice), but I have seen that they delivered today and left it with my neighbor! Puma is much better!Update: I was angry when I wrote a review above. I mean who cares for the conf email if the shoes arrive two days later!  And shoes are great. The best ones so far. Very comfortable and light! I recooment them to everyone. Will buy more soon!",19 March 2021,DE
David Oriordan,"Was buying 3 pair of trainers and I was spending €300 for them. Placed the order and the delivery time was over two weeks which I was surprised. Paid for the trainers and a few days later I got an email from Nike saying I was being refunded, no explanation why or anything. Had to ring them and I was told the paperwork was incorrect, and Nike was at fault. I had a promo code that I used and asked would I get to use it if I ordered again and said they would email me and let me know when I could order again. Got and email saying I was refunded and that’s all I got. Disappointed with them.",18 March 2021,IE
Michelle L,"A regular customer, who was given no assurance that a refund would be processed because they implied a return would need to be investigated further because I didn't have proof of postage. I pointed out, had they checked the return status, it's clearly been processed through royal mail and back with them. My query wasn't where is it or its been lost by royal mail. My query was why haven't you processed my refund when I can see that you received it over 2 weeks ago. It has taken 2.5 weeks for my £350 refund to be processed. Absolutely no regard for the customer, no support or urgency to assist you, and after the 3rd time contacting customer ""services"" they had the cheek to wish me a happy Nike day after telling me my case would need to be investigated. Just another example of a big company who doesn't care about customer experience, relying on brand loyalty to keep customers. They won't read or care about this review but I feel better for writing it. Absolute disgrace of a retailer.",18 March 2021,GB
Debra,I had a three year old pair of Nike slides I bought at shoe carnival in size 7.  They fit perfectly.  I bought a new pair of slides off Nike.com the end of February in size 7.  When delivered I was disappointed that my heels hung over the back of the slides.  I returned them to a Nike store near me and was advised they didn’t sell that particular slide there.  So I reordered it on the Nike app in a size 8.  They were delivered today. I more than likely could have gone with 8 1/2.! WTH Nike???!!!!!!!!,17 March 2021,US
Elena P.,"This was the worst online shopping experience I had in many years, maybe ever. I've spent a good few hours trying to buy a pair of sneakers.First, my birthday discount code was called ""invalid"", although it was well within the promo period, copy-pasted with precision from the Nike email. I ended up not using it.Second, I kept getting cryptic error codes when checking out, tried different bank cards, and payment methods to no luck.Third, when I finally managed to complete the purchase (by creating a new account, clearing all cookies (!) and paying with PayPal), my order got cancelled 2 days later. And the sneakers I wanted to buy are now unavailable.When speaking to customer service representative about the cancellation, they said that my ""billing details couldn't be verified"", which doesn't make any sense: PayPal was happy and successful in taking the payment, my bank was happy to charge the account, I use these billing details on dozens of other sites, my browser auto-fills them (but of course I double checked them too), and they even match my delivery address. What else do you need, Nike, seriously?",17 March 2021,GB
He,Awful customer service placed a order a number of weeks ago and there is no record of my order whatever but the money has been taken out of my bank? Was told the issue would be resolved 3-5 workings day and I am STILL waiting for someone to even email me back. Have had to ring every single day to ask where my order or refund is to be told the same thing ‘we have not looked at it yet’ awful customer service and WILL not ever be ordering from urselfs again. Absolutely disgusting how you can take peoples money and not even stick to the SLA you have provided. Awful,17 March 2021,GB
john,"We own 2 golf courses and we have been loyal customers of Nike for 17 years, we have sold polos, hats, shoes, balls, and always had nike apparel available to our customers, we have never missed or have been late on a payment in all that time.December 2020 a bill was missed for $244, it was a crazy year with staffing and pandemic and we missed it, as soon as we were notified it was missed, we put it in for payment it was only 30 days late it was due Dec 5th, and Nike recieved payment Jan 8th Colsten your finance man sent us to collections after he knew it was sent and we gave him the check number, then he closed our account for good, I believe Nike doesnt want to deal with little businesses anymore.17 years of loyalty and no one will return our calls .Customer number 94618",17 March 2021,US

Conor O'Brien,I am a regular customer on this site and delivery has always been timely. One recommendation would be to attempt to try on the runners/boots in a store prior to ordering (if the cost benefit exists to use the site as a result of discounts etc) as sizing over differing shoe types can lead to the shoe not always realising the perfect fit.,14 March 2021,IE

Gregory Wolfinger,"On February 12th my wife was scammed into buying Nike gift cards. I immediately contacted Nike and they stopped the transaction. They sent me an email saying the funds have been secured and are being held by Blackhawk, the company that administers their gift cards. The email also stated that the store where the cards were purchased should contact Blackhawk and the funds would be transferred to the store. Then the store could reimburse me. So Dave the manager of Food Lion contacted Blackhawk and for 45 minutes was stonewalled by them. They refused to send the funds to Food Lion.I exchanged several emails trying to resolve this but they say there is nothing they can do and would not reply to any further emails.I am a senior over 75 years of age. So from my perspective Nike is not only taking advantage of seniors but are scamming people who have been scammed.",13 March 2021,US
Harris Papadopoulos,"I ordered a kid's jacket for 60 euro and some socks. My order no. C00456056151. The possible delivery date passed without me receiving anything. When i tried to call customer support their answer was that there was a problem and the order was never sent. I asked if i did something wrong or if i missed any info mail from them but they told me that it was not my fault and i should make the order again. Only, that now the same jacket had a price tag of 85 euro instead of 60... I would never expect such behaviour from a brandname of this size. In my opinion it was a fake offer and they changed their mind about the price. They even refused to let me order it again with the same price since they saw my order and the price i originally ordered. NEver heard the real reason (or even a fake one) i didnt receive my order neither i was informed that i am not. My son was waiting for the jacket.. Iwill NEVER buy a nike product again, there are hundreds of brandnames out there that respect their customers much much more",12 March 2021,GR

Compelled to review after I recently got my first faulty item, fault occurred after return period. I spoke to an ACTUAL person on the end of the customer service chat who was so nice and had the issue resolved really quickly. Can’t wait till the shops reopen as Nike Outlet is superb for end of line and reduced stuff. Online shopping is so easy with free shipping and returns.

Callum Millar,"Placed an order last Monday for around £200, became a Nike member because I saw you got free shipping, placed order it all went through fine. Later that evening I realised I had forgotten to order some stuff so tried to order them and it didn’t go through. I spoke to the online support the next day and was told to wait 24 hours and try again. I did this and it still didn’t work, so I called up to speak to someone who explained that Nike only let you order once in 24 hours and to wait another 24 hours before trying again. I waited the additional 24 hours and it still didn’t work. I then rang up again and the lady on the phone confirmed it should have worked and that she would escalate by account to the ‘senior team’ and that I could order again when they got in contact to say the issue was sorted. They emailed be last Thursday and I got round to trying to order again today. My order still wouldn’t go through, went onto live chat again and the guy on the other end did not reply for 45 minutes.

Chada GC,"I ordered a gift card online for my friend's birthday in October. Two weeks later, it hadn't arrived so I queried with Nike who explained it said it had been delivered on their end but were going to try and help. Gift card suddenly showed up a week later and this is where the ordeal began. I usually don't go out of my way to give bad reviews but I was completely appalled and have JUST received a replacement online gift card....5 months later.1) The gift card code for the original gift card was invalid. We were told on different occasions that it was used, invalid, expired, an incorrect Nike gift card and it was a £250 card for Vitality (so they told us to contact a completely different company). Not once did anyone try to rectify this. 2) I cannot count how many times I chased up just getting a replacement gift card e-mailed to me so I could nip this in the bud. Every two weeks I was told it would be dealt with and would be resolved that very week. 3) It is now March and I have been forwarded the gift card by e-mail. I haven't received an apology, or an acknowledgement of how much time I have wasted with this ordeal - literally ""here's your gift card code and pin"". From the looks of all the reviews there is a real problem with ordering online from Nike and understandably with the pandemic this was bound to happen. However in my situation, the buck has been passed too many times to count and it's clear Nike has to get its formalities and training procedures in check for problems like these!",02 March 2021,GB

It is Feb 27, 2021 and I only received the other sneakers. When I continue to contact NIKE. COM about my Jordans they keep giving excuses that due to inclement weather the sneakers have not been shipped. I considered their excuses and today on Feb 27, 2021 I received the other sneakers but never received my Jordans. Nike.com chat representatives continue to lie and say that my Jordans are being sent from Memphis TN and the weather held up the shipment and my other order came from a different warehouse, which is a lie. My other sneakers came from Memphis, TN, which is the same warehouse that the Jordans were supposed to be shipped from but never arrived and still have not been shipped. They had to nerves to send me a tracking number for my Jordans without sending the sneakers to Fedx. I will be filing a small claims lawsuit because they took my money from my credit card but refuse to send me my item i purchased. They continue to blame the weather with their lies and on the NIKE.COM website it is showing my item have been shipped when it is not.

The red color is bleeding into the white on the side of the shoes, and its also bleeding into the sole of the shoes! My entire shoe looks red and pink instead of red and white like they should. Some people are saying ""well thats just how some of them are showing up, you bought them so thats your problem! Noooo...its Nike's problem not mine, and Im not the only person who feels this way. These are the worst pair of Jordan's that I have ever purchased in years! Im so disappointed in Jordan Brand, and Nike for the quality of this particular shoe! I really wanted these because it was the first time in almost 30 years that they were released with the Nike swoosh on the back!

They ended up being too big for me so I had to return them. The returns process was the easiest and fastest I’ve ever experienced with any online shop ever. I took them to the post office on Thursday, and by Monday the return had been acknowledged and the refund had been submitted to my credit card. The returns process was so easy that it made me confident enough to try another pair of running shoes. The second pair were also delivered quickly and this time they fit perfectly and I love them. Thank you Nike",26 February 2021,GB
Aaron Woolcock,Nike by you. Simply awful. No premium materials. Custom Air Max 1 came in a felt material. Unwearable. I buy adidas instead now 10x better quality and materials,25 February 2021,GB
John T Thames,Order was delayed without my notice. Significantly so. Then it never arrived and when I contacted UPS about the tracking number they informed me Nike never sent a package in the first place. Customer service sucked and sent out a new order with two day shipping. Very annoying but fine. Except... that never shipped and doesn’t have a tracking number either. Total scammers,23 February 2021,US

When I hit the update order button I get no reply email on status. Finally got an update through live chat but no apology for the issues I had experienced, just a promise they are still in transit. The contrast between this and most online shopping is stark. Would never buy shoes through Nike.com again - extremely unprofessional service.",22 February 2021,AU
Ace Gaming,I bought from nike only twice once for the jordan 11 25th anniversarys and airforce 1 valentines. when i got the jordan 11s they were clearly used and had a huge crease on the side and when i asked for a exchange they pretty much said F you i know u spend money and you want the shoes but we wont give u a exchange even tho now we know they had more in stock because they released them again this week. Then when i bought the airforce 1 valentines and they didnt even ship it out its still pending. i just want my shoes is that to much to ask for,22 February 2021,US

Ronno,"The underpaid sweatshop kids working for nike must be the ones running their all their departments. Shares  above 141 Phil Knight, BlackRock Inc, Mark Parker, Andrew Campion, Swoosh LLC, and Vanguard Group Inc., must be proud of their earnings while their staff bounce off walls trying to walk as they couldn't even to the basic stuff in the way of customer satisfaction.. unless you're sponsored and overpaid.

Ken,"Usless trying to place orders. All details correct, payments, etc correct. Confirmed through customer services and phone multiple times. Payment gets taken every time only to be cancelled hours later. Every time they say it's a bank issue. Bank fraud team confirms they allowed all payments, Nike accepted all payments. Nike then decided to not take payment and gave no reason, as there is none on my end. However senior team said it's bank again, it's not. The problem is where the payment goes to later on and the senior team. Same issues, every time no fault on my end. Fill you with same B.S. every time and say issues are sorted. I payed missed out on so many drops and items because of this and no one at Nike is capable of fixing the issue. Problem is with the UK branch. Spoke to the US branch and they said everything seems fine but they can't fix issues caused by the UK branch. Wish I could get paid to be useless.",17 February 2021,GB
Gabriela Lima,"Worst customer service.I bought I pair of sneakers, choose the collection at a collection point, as it was marked as FREE and in the end, they charged me 5 euros.

C. G.,"Waited two months for a new release to become available - created an account ahead of time, added payment details and address. Thinking all I'd need to do was click 'buy'.Release happened at 8AM, I clicked 'buy' - they then made me have to put in a code sent by text. Once this was inputted, it just went back to the main page. So I had to 'buy' again, it then sent another text then asked me to re-input payment details. Then an error code showed. I had to go through this text/payment details process another THREE TIMES, then another error code showed so I refreshed - and the item was sold out.I contacted their live messaging and the advisor basically said it was my fault for not taking a picture of the code (who does that?) and that's life.Slow clap for Nike. Probably the worst online services I've ever used - terribly designed transaction system and arsey advisors. I promptly deleted my account. If you want Nike shoes, buy from another retailer.",17 February 2021,GB
Johana Kruse,"Nike is a horrible company that scams people, my daughter order a pair of shoes she didn't like them so she returned them, this people abvertice free returns well is false not only she had to paid $8 for shipping (most places offer free shipping on orders $50 and up) and in top of that she had to paid almost $13 to returned them( nike didn't put a return label when they shipped the shoes and when we called them about it they said we have to pay for the shipping to return the shoes) are you kidding me!!! and they haven't give my daughter her money back even though we returned the shoes two weeks ago, after talking to someone in customer service I was told I will receive an email and I have to reply to that email with a photo of the receipt with the tracking number ( we check and the shoes were delivered to the warehouse already)by the way I never got the email,so this people are trying to waste my time pretending they didn't got the shoes, so they don't have to refund the money which was almost $100.

Caroline Donohoe,"I got a pair of Nike Air Max 270 for my son in July 2020 costing €150.00. By Oct the sole of the shoe was pulling away so I contacted Nike.com to see if I could get them replaced.  They gave me a return label which I had to send the runners back which cost €18.00 but they said if my claim was approved this would be refunded also. On the email it said once approved I would get a gift card within 2 weeks.  After 3-4 weeks I contacted Nike and was told my claim was approved and I would receive an email with my gift card.  Great you would think...but No.  Roll on 4 months and after numerous calls and online chat...at last on 15th Jan '21 I received my gift card (without the postage) but at that stage I was just glad to get the voucher.  (Even though I had bought and paid for another pair of Nike Air Max 270 in the meantime) Now wait for it.... 2 weeks later I went onto their website to order a pair of runners for my daughter, put in the voucher code and pin and it said balance NIL.  So now I am back to square one of this saga.  To say I am ready to explode is an understatement. I don't think I have ever dealt with a company with a customer service as bad as this.  When I contacted them got the usual bull of we will escalate it to their seniors but no explanation of how I got a gift voucher with a zero balance....",16 February 2021,IE

Why, because I place an order for trainers, the wrong trainers came and I return them back. After a month and a half had to call my bank for my refund. I left thousand of dollars in Nike outlet Woodstock GA. All of my sport clothes and trainers are Nike.

Jimm Nolan,"Nike staff are thief’s ! By mistake a parcel was sent to Nike ‘returns label left in box’ they have stolen my star bucks LV cups I had custom made. Nike claim they have received the box ‘they would have to as tracking information proves it’s been delivered’ and claiming the content inside isn’t there’ LIARS. My receipt proves there was just more than a box sent under ‘how much the box & content WEIGHED’. Thief’s!!!! Nike could find the person who done this, but the day bad time tracking information provides and who was working via rota that day taking the parcels! But can’t be bothered and have stolen my cups.

Anonymous,Customer service are soo helpful. I purchased a pair of trainers with my 25% birthday discount a month ago and I decided I wanted to exchange the colour and it was so easy to do so. I told the customer service assistant and he processed the exchange for me straight away and sent me a return label to my email and the new shoes arrived 4 days later. Super quick and super helpful. Highly highly reccomend. I’ve purchased about 4 shoes over the past 6 months and every time has been such an easy experience.,12 February 2021,GB

I have been very pleased with the quality of all items apart from some Nikepro synthetic tracksuit trousers which have ripped around the heel.The custom shoes have been of very good quality. In addition, the delivery has usually been fast for all items (relative, obviously the custom shoes take much longer but both have arrived before the allotted date)Generally, I have been happy with the products.

I joined their chat to ask about the availability of a product and Sade told me the product is sold out but she recommended me an authorized retailer from where I can purchase the product. I did so and I didn’t get anything ever. After some research I found out that website called SEPSPORT.COM is a FRAUD!!! I can’t believe Nike scammed me!! That’s unbelievable.

I do not have a printer, requested a paper returns labelto be sent by post. Waited 2 weeks, no label. Called them and they assured me it had been sent out. Waited another week, no label. Called again and on 22nd January they said they would send another one. Waited 10 days , no label. Called again, this time the assistant said to wait 3 more days then she would call me to check. No call, no label. Last night, Feb 2nd, I called again, this tome I was told they are not sending out returns labels at the moment. So why had 3 customer service assistants told me it was on its way? Have now had to find a print shop which is still open and pay a minimum charge of £5 to get a label. Shocking inneficiency, Nike.

Rodrigo Rodriguez-Fernandez,"I current work as a doctor in one of the most hard hit CPVDI19 cities in the world. I use running as an outlet to release stress from the day. I decided to treat myself this December by ordering a pair of running trainers online. When they arrived and did not fit, I went to the local Nike store to see if I could get another pair. Given their low stock, they suggested they take the trainers and they would help place a larger size order online. After a month, I called to ask about my order. They had lost my order. When I asked if they could send another, they said NO and all they could do was return my money and I would have to buy them again. I have been on the phone to them a total of 11 times since December. This is what I have been made to do now while I have time off from seeing COVID19 patient. Speak on the phone to Nike and explain the situation over and over again, asking for my refund with no results. Needles to say, I still have not received my refund and every time I call I have to explain the situation again. I have send endless bank statements etc. Nothing seems to work. At this point I think the Pandemic will be over faster than I can get my money back. DONY BUY ANYTHING FROM NIKE ONLINE.",02 February 2021,GB

LD,"May order was delivered to a pick-up store without me getting informed about it. After a week I got an email saying it was gonna be returned to nike, for I did not pick it up. I’ve waited for a week and did not get any return so I contacted them several times via „report an issue“- no answer. Then I tried via only chat several times until I got an answer. The guy was beyond rude, trying to belittle me and telling me how to properly handle picking up orders. I made clear that I did not receive a note and he was just like „you always get a note from the delivery guy“ We all know this is not the case- at all, especially nowadays. It’s whatever, he did manage to get me my refund and mentioned in a rude manner that I should check where my parcel is earlier than a month Next time. I ask if this was normal for him to treat customers like that, when he doesn’t even know the circumstances why someone was not able to pick it up. Just disgusting how people treat other people. His answer was btw, that he always makes the point clear. So I guess it’s normal to get bad customer service at Nike. It’s 2 stars, because I never had an issue before and it’s more about STEVE the Ride Customer Agent from Germany :)",01 February 2021,DE

I purchased three higher end models from them: Air Max Plus III, VaporMax Plus and Air Max 270 and they all arrived with damaged boxes. I returned them for refund and all were successfully delivered - I had used their own prepaid returns labels and posted them via Yodel and Royal Mail. Once delivered I reminded them that I wanted my money back, and their answer was they had not received any of them!. Despite me showing evidence of each successful delivery they had the nerve to claim they had all not been received!. Daylight thieves!. They refused for many weeks to hand over the refunds owed to the point where I had to open PayPal cases to recover the money. PayPal decided in my favour in all three cases, but Nike claimed they still had not received anything!. It is beggar's belief how stupid their staff are. They then went on to block my debit cards, my addresses, and my two Nike accounts because they said that I was 'fraudulent' and that anyone who makes a Chargeback against them or opens a PayPal claim against them will be automatically blocked. They said they will never be reopening my accounts. They are rotten to the core.",23 January 2021,GB

Sherlyn Jenkins,"They have the worst website experience.  I haven't felt this furious in years.  My college son living away from home tried to order a bunch of items for his birthday.   We have a family credit card that we share.   Nike rejected the cc for no reason.  Card has absolutely no issues.   I told him I would place the order for him assuming his wifi had issues.  It rejected cc my house too.   I called the company and rep  told me his account was locked.   I hung up and I made my own account and it rejected my cc again because apparently it's now a blocked card.  Then I tried and different card and it was rejected.  I called company and tried to use 3 different credit cards including my debit with representative on the phone.   The customer service guy said my account was locked and once it's locked, no new cards work. It also takes days to unlock it and apparently this happens ALL OF THE THIME   He said it would take several days for Nike to even get back to me.   I couldn't even place the order over the phone. I even tried checking out as guest but no luck because once credit card is blocked, it blocks all cards through the IP address, phone number,  email etc.   This is completely idiotic.  I am a customer ready to buy goods and they can't process an order.   Nike rep told me to go buy a gift card and it would work.  Not happening!  This is the first time I've ever had a cc rejected online. I will never shop their website again.  After reading this website, I see it happens to other people too!  Disgraceful.",22 January 2021,US
FatBones Life,This has been a dumpster fire. I purchased a pair of Air Max 90 Flyease for my girlfriend’s Christmas present. The shoes got here in 3 days. Great. They were half a size too big. I did an in store exchange and they ordered the correct size. It took them 2 weeks to inform me they were no longer in stock and discontinued. All the while the website still had them listed. On top of that the refund never came. Thank God my bank removed the charge. Ridiculous for such a large company.,21 January 2021,US
Jess,Horrible customer service experience. The website is so stupid it will not let me purchase a pair of trainers as it keeps saying invalid payment method after trying 3 different payment methods and contacting my bank and customer service are so unhelpful I have been waiting almost a month for them to sort it out. They leave me over a week with no response. On top of this I had spoken to someone who had confirmed I qualified for the 25% off birthday offer which I never received I think its a CON to get people to sign up to their club.,21 January 2021,GB

Valeria Tomlin,I ordered a jacket on the 9th it came on the 13th but it was to big so I paid 15.00 on that same day to return it I than ordered a smaller size I got a email saying it was in process for the smaller size now it’s the 19th and they are refusing to refund my money 💰 because the order isn’t showing canceled but yet the manager told me it’s not in stock now they are refusing to expedite my refund of 146.00 people please don’t do business with Nike on line I’ve talk to 23 people before I got the truth they are so incompetent and their customer service is terrible because they are on their butts at home I’m done with this company,20 January 2021,US
Autumn Hayes,"If you're looking to order shoes right now.. don't. Nike took 21 days before cancelling my order due to unavailability. Meanwhile over the course of 3 weeks they sent emails explaining the SHIPPING had been delayed, as if the order was already sent. All the while my shoes had not been removed from stock and Nike sold them to someone else then emailed me 21 days later nonchalantly telling me they item isn't available. HORRIBLE customer service. They lie to you blatantly and doesn't even think to hold your items to the side. What kind of company does this?I'm very upset and expected more from NIKE.Even after speaking to a representative on the phone for 20 minutes, she offered to send a coupon for my troubles.. confirmed my email and never sent. Customer Service is miserable at Nike... honestly, not surprised considering how they treat their overseas employees in sweatshops... (but thats a talk for another day)",20 January 2021,US

Daniyal Ahmed,"They don’t deliver the goods. It’s been 4 days since my order has not been shipped. The irony is that I ordered a Reebok jacket on the same day, got the Reebok one, the next day. That’s the sort of sloppy service we are taking about. The customer services, had trouble understanding my concern. They need training and a better skill-set to comprehend customers problems.",19 January 2021,PK
Tom S,"I placed an order for 5 items they dispatch 4 then 2 days later tell me the last is unavailable, this is the second time this has happened in a week.I then email them asking to cancel the other items as I only ordered them to go with the items out of stock and they told me they can’t cancel them as they have been dispatched.Absolutely shocking service as I should have been informed items arent in stock at time of dispatch not 2 days after leaving it to late to do anything about it.",19 January 2021,GB
Yvonne Peters,Can't upload files to their online chat. Told I would be emailed a returns label etc. Never received them. Products are cheap material and overpriced. For example my running jacket bobbled and frayed within weeks.,19 January 2021,GB
Dale,"Disgusting customer service, returned a pair of trainers and they refused to refund me. Returned them the same day they was delivered  literally tried them on and put them back in the box. Some trainers I've recieved have been worn which clearly shows, scratches on them, scuff Marks. Footlocker any day now. Nike a re a complete waste of time. Over priced crap. Stay well clear.",18 January 2021,GB
Michael Cauldwell,"Very odd experience. I placed an order for a pair of running trainers, using a birthday discount and gift vouchers. The order was processed efficiently, and the trainers arrived but were half a size too small (no fault of Nike's). Unfortunately, there was no stock of the half size up.I contacted the Nike team via chat, and explained that I wanted to return the shoes, and exchange them for an alternative which didn't have the toe box, and would fit me. I was assured that they had set everything to trigger the exchange automatically once the replacement shows were returned.Three days later, I received a notification to say that my replacement shoes were being dispatched. When I checked the order, exactly the same model, colour and size as i had just returned were being sent back to me. Again I reached out to the team on chat, who this time told me that they can only exchange like for like, and can't exchange for different models. I questioned where the logic was in sending me back the same shoes I'd just returned, but was told that they had assumed I'd meant the same shoe, in black?!  I re-read the previous chat and had clearly stated the different model. In any case, they weren't even sending me the previous shoe in black, it was literally the same one.Nike also told me that they couldn't cancel the dispatch, and that I had to wait to get the tracking number, and then contact them again so they could get in touch with DPD to see if it could be cancelled.It's a very strange and disjointed process for such a big brand. Also, given their boasts on the packaging about reducing the carbon footprint etc. etc., it's laughable that they don't have a process in place to be able to cancel incorrect orders in house. They'll wait for it to be dispatched, ship out to the customer unnecessarily and then do what they can.Pretty rubbish experience all around - very much computer says no and a complete lack of joined up thinking.",18 January 2021,GB
Jeffrey Jenkins,I can't believe how Hard it is to get a pair of trainers from nike now a days the normal person that works 9 to 5 cannot buy a pair because of the way you have marketed the whole nike //off white // jordans etc iv bin trying to get a pair for over a year and prior to that aswell .. and ill not be getting them off a reseller as a £100 pair are like £500 this is a joke and ther come off with sum BS ... I hope you get bk to me and not just air the message,16 January 2021,GB
Tony Worsfold,"I'm a massive fan of the classic suede AF1 trainers, but Nike have stopped making them. My partner did her best to design a pair using the customise option (paying a considerable premium in the process) as an Xmas gift. Unfortunately the availabile materials are limited to the usual (boring) soft leather, or ""rippled leather"". My other half went with rippled as it was 'different'. Unfortunately, when they arrived, the rippled leather looks like cheap shiny plastic rubbish, nothing like leather at all. Also, she ordered a size 9.5, which came up nearer a 10.5-11. I had about an inch of space in the toe. I reached out to their customer service to ask why such limited options, considering the expense of customised trainers, but received a generic response stating there are no plans to offer a wider range of materials. Avoiding the actual question of ""WHY"".Needless to say the trainers are on their way back, and we are waiting for a full refund. Unfortunately, it looks like I'm going to break my run consecutive pairs of AF1's. Currently looking at DC shoes as a potential permanent replacement. Disappointed!",14 January 2021,GB
Natalie 'natnat' Keogh,"I wish Nike would claim this page because I’m shocked at the customer service problems people are having. I’ve NEVER had a problem with them and I buy a lot of runners from Nike. I’ve always held them in high regard. I would give 5 stars but after reading everyone’s reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that, maybe one person could be wrong but not 20+ people! Shame on you Nike you have gone down in my estimations. Your customer service should be better than your products, not the other way round.",14 January 2021,GB
Nicholas Leon,"I ordered a couple of pants and some running shoes. When registering my address I forgot my apt# so I called to add it.

Afrodhite Sovolos-Rouvas,"Nike entice you to become a member, spend at least $500 to receive a $50 voucher. The catch? At time of transaction amounting to over $500, you need to wait two working days for an email to then spend it. Why isn’t it instant????? Not a very genuine way to value your customers. Have provided feedback more than 15 days ago and yet to receive a reply.",13 January 2021,AU
brooke sharp,Customer service is the worst! I had 2 good experiences and the rest even with supervisors are horrible. I will probably never order from Nike again because of this. I can’t believe a company like this would be so rude to it’s customers.,12 January 2021,US

John Cassidy,"It is so disappointing that I have to write this review.  I love NIke, I am obsessed with AirMax 90's, but I am not a fan of the customer service.  I order at least a pair of trainers a month, but I have come across so many problems from their website not taking payments, to deliveries not arriving when they say they would.  When you contact them, they fob you off and tell you that when you receive the product they will honour a gesture of good will, but that is just 10% off which I get already being a student.  Such a shame as I love your products.",11 January 2021,GB

If nike is going to keep asking premium prices for there gear they need to check the quality better. You definitely don't get what you pay for. Kinda pisses me off they charge so much for there gear and you get crap in return. Extremely disappointed and feel like I got ripped off. Guess I'll have to start buying no name brands, at least they are decent quality. Especially when you pay half the price and the quality far exceeds nike.",09 January 2021,US

No one I have spoken to at Nike has taken any genuine interest or actively tried to resolve the issue. Great sportswear but simply shocking service!",07 January 2021,GB
Anthony Fusco,"Generally Nike is great with anything automated. However, chat representatives can be unwilling to make proper effort to resolve issues when you have to reach beyond the automated processes. Today, Nike’s carrier delayed my package for a second time, and i was unable to get resolution through them. Contacted Nike cs through chat and rep was unwilling to do anything but tell me tracking details of which i was already aware. The shoes i purchased cost $500, which is an astronomical price, of course, which makes clear how much i wanted them in the first place. Reps should be making exceptional efforts never mind the basic one that was lacking today to connect customers to their desired products-this was supposed to be a late Christmas gift to myself not a hassle and point of frustration due to the poor effort of Nike’s chat representative.Perhaps opt to call rather than message: my experience on the phone has always been positive: that option was not viable for me today unfortunately.",06 January 2021,US

Deborah Nash,"The worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. I would highly recommend you avoid Nike and shop at one of the many other competitors who have vastly better customer service policies. Nike cares about money, they honestly couldn’t care less about you as a customer. I received some Nike shoes as a Christmas present. These were purchased from the Pitt Street, Sydney Nike store. They weren’t my style, so I decided to exchange them as there were 3-5 different shoes I preferred on the Nike website. The pair of shoes I received were full price, unworn and I had the receipt (which was less than 30 days after the sale) so I assumed this wouldn’t be a problem. My husband took the shoes back to the Nike Pitt Street Store. None of the 5 shoes I preferred were available. But, we couldn’t get a refund. Apparently this wasn’t their policy. I was surprised and disappointed at this as I worked in footwear retail for two large companies during university and both would always refund unworn stock within the given exchange period if proof of purchase was presented. I also working at head office for two fashion retailers during my corporate career, and both also offered refunds. So, I am familiar with the retail space. I decided to try and exchange the shoes again and took them to the Nike, Birkenhead Point outlet. Again, none of the shoes I had seen on the website were available. Nothing remotely similar was available. There was also no signage explaining their strict return policy at the store entry.I decided to ring another Nike store, Burwood, to see if they had any products that might be suitable for an exchange. The staff member was helpful and looked up a number of products for me, none of which were available. Instead of offering a refund, all stores offered a credit or exchange. However, I went out of my way to find a product at 3 stores that was suitable for exchange and there was nothing available. It did not help that the products listed on their website were different from those instore, and there was no function on the website to determine what products were available at what stores. These shoes were expensive. It is not useful for me to have over $200 of dead Nike credit when I don’t like any of their products. Particularly in this economic climate.This type of return policy is not common and so should have bee made obvious through inshore signage and verbally by staff at point of sale. I’m imploring anyone reading this to NOT shop at Nike. They waste your time and money. There are so many fantastic competitors in this category (i.e Platypus, New Balance, JD Sports), who have much better refund policies - you have a choice!",05 January 2021,AU

Started a return , to be told I have to print a return label. I don’t own a printer. To be told by Nike that I’d have to find one!! Eventually they arrange dpd to come and collect them. But now dpd are saying they’ve not been scanned since the 29th and I’ve gotta contact Nike to start an investigation!!! I hate this company now. Don’t have this problem ordering their products from other sites. But Nike.com them selves are atrocious. Just another example of a big company that’s stopped caring. The customer service staff are rude and uncaring. And the live chat is a joke. Unhelpful awful experience. Never again.",03 January 2021,GB
Andrew,"I submitted a warranty return on 1st October for a pair of faulty trainers. There was no acknowledgement of receipt, nor any update. I have contacted Nike pretty much every 1-2 weeks via chat/phone to be fobbed off at every occasion. On one of these calls, a Nike call handler told me I had sent back an empty box! Fast forward to December, now told I need to send a bank statement as proof of purchase, despite sending all of this in October, to wait a further 5-8days. That takes upto present day, where i’m told another 3-4 weeks to wait. Throughout, no correspondence, no updates as assured by Nike staff when enquiring.I am rarely moved to make consumer reviews, positive or negative but this is the worst experience I have ever had. If there was a zero star option this still would be too generous.",02 January 2021,GB
Heather VanVorhis,I ordered (and paid) for joggers on Dec 11. Dec 12 Nike sent me a UPS tracking number via email saying my item shipped. I never received the Christmas gift for my son. When I call UPS to track they tell me Nike created the tracking number but never gave them the merch. When I talked to Nike they say UPS has the merch. Nike refunded my $ but no longer have the item in stock. Very disappointing. I ordered in plenty of time for Christmas and assumed they were on their way. If I would have known Nike didn’t follow through on their end I could have reorders or found a replacement gift instead of spending hours trying to find my sons $100 joggers!!!!,01 January 2021,US

Thankfully I paid via PayPal so I have opened a claim with against Nike as they refuse to acknowledge my messages.  I can say honestly that it’s the worst Customer Service I have ever received. After 2 weeks of non-stop calls they still have ignored me every time I have made contact. Buyer beware, if you need help you will receive nothing.

This was months ago and up until today as far as they are concerned, they will do nothing about it. I spoke to the head of europe at Nike on the phone and be basically told me to f*** off.

Turns out it was my fault as i used the incorrect returns label, but they sorted it out quickly and have processed the refund.

mehvish,I am a regular customer of nike and never had a problem until now. A pair of 720s develped a fault and i contacted nike and they agreed that they are under their warranty and told me to send them back for a full refund. The return was initiated on 13 NOV 2020 and i posted the trainers on 20/11/20. After chasing so many times the money has still not been refunded and every time a new story is told and wait a few more days and money will be transferred. I think it is all a lie and i have escalated the matter to my bank now. Extremely disappointed.,18 December 2020,GB

Adam Bulbala,Do not order from Nike ! Do not ! They have the worst customer service and quite clearly do not give a damn about there customer service I ordered a tech fleece. Some of the money was payed by gift card the rest by card the tech fleece came n it was too big for me so I returned it to the Nike store in Oxford. Where the person who I was returning my goods to was very rude and deceiving. I asked him what about my gift card am I going to get refunded the money I only payed for card and not the gift card . He said no no not to worry the money will all be in your account give it a minimum of 10 working days. 6 days later only the money I payed by card was returned back to me and not the gift card I called customer service spoke to many agents they were all so rude they said there’s no proof to track the funds for your gift card we have refunded the total cost of your order I find Nike condescending and deceiving they think just because they are a prestigious brand they can disregard there customer I ADVISE NO ONE TO ORDER FROM NIKE NO ONE !

Contacted them and they said they never received it...I have shipping confirmation that they did. So now, I am waiting for their ELITE customer service team to email me.

I called Nike as I was away on holiday when I purchased and was asked to send photos of shoes and I would receive a refund. I did this and didn’t receive anything. Rang a few weeks later to be asked to send bank statements to prove purchase. Did this and still no refund. Was then told I couldn’t have a refund , as it was a store purchase and to drive 300 miles back to the store.   I told them this wasn’t acceptable and eventually they said send shoes back and get a refund. They received shoes 11th November and still no refund. Rang them 4 times since and spent over 4 hours on the phone and still no refund. Really frustrating as they have no contact other than 1 phone number where the staff refuse to help.

The have no sense of customer service at all at the store, I had an issue related to the refund I got for a return and first of all the refund was given on a paper money (here in Sweden) and they gave me this knowing that the store was gonna close in half a year. When I went to the only store open to ask them if I could get money back or be able to purchase this online, there was no option to do that. And the store manager insisted it was my fault that I did not ask for money back and they were not willing to take ownership of the issue. I contacted customer service to get an online code so I can buy online instead but my only option was to go to this little store (the only one in Stockholm) where there is no assortment to my liking and insists that I should buy things for the sake of buying.The customer service or the store manager was of no help!",10 December 2020,SE

This is useless.. The product was in stock when I placed the exchange. I asked the representative the first time if it would be easier if I just bought the new product and then send this other one back, but he assured me that this was easier.

As soon as I question it, again I get cut off by the rudest most unhelpful advisor yet!Shocking, says alot that they don't have a complaints department either.I will be writing to the ombudsman should this not get sorted fast.Its borderline theft as I dont believe I'll recieve said refund.Global company....

I offered to pick it up because it was a present and its maybe 30mins away, but they won’t let me.

W G,"tl;dr: the worst order fulfilment I have ever experienced. 15 days with no dispatch and nobody who can give me any information as to the item's whereabouts. Order placed for a pair of overpriced running shoes on the 22nd November, with the 2-4 day delivery option. Instantly given a delivery day of 1st December, which was quite a lot later but not a major issue.It's now the 8th December, and numerous 'Nike Representatives' have been utterly incapable of helping me locate the order. Instead, they inform me that I am not the only person with this issue, and that they are struggling to locate orders and fulfil them. The appropriate response in a situation like this would be to close the website to further orders until you have caught up with demand. There is not any indication on the website that orders cannot and will not be fulfilled.  It appears that most Nike customers in the UK are in the same boat.For an extremely wealthy global brand whose image is synonymous with speed and excellence, this is a very sad place for them to end up. I wonder if the American HQ is aware that their UK wing has been outsourced to incompetents?",08 December 2020,GB
Erica,"I wanted to buy some gift cards and tried to buy them, to save time, through the website and then through the app. No joy with neither option so I bit the bullet and rang their customer service and after 10 mins of holding, I got through and ordered the cards. I had the email confirming the order. And this is where Nike failed me. After not receiving the cards by the date stated and finding out that the pending payment had ’disappeared’ from my bank I contacted customer service ( Generous ) who assured me that my order would be fulfilled and that I would receive an email from her/him updating me and with a link. Suffice to say no email. So I am again back on the phone and Ignacio will ’escalate ’ this problem/complaint. He also questioned my bank...had they refused payment? I assured him they hadn't and if they had surely Nike would have contacted me re: problems with payment. Given that the payment had been pending for 4 days then disappeared I dismissed his query.Now you won't be surprised he promised that I would receive an email, because it had been escalated, from a superviser / manager. I haven't !All in all the whole experience has been shocking  A HUGE company like Nike cannot fulfill an order...which in itself is not that complicated. To date I’m still not sure if I will get my order and so will have to source gift cards from other retailers. If I could have got the cards elsewhere - Amazon, Supermarket I would have and I’m almost sure  the experience and customer service would be far better than Nike.",07 December 2020,GB
Brittany Bradley,"I am placing a large order for Nike for my company. The process at this point has taken about 3 weeks. I am committed to it at this point because I've spent so much time, but am not even close to having my order completed. I cannot get on the line with any human who can help me through issues, and keep getting told my request is being escalated. It takes 2-5 business days to get even a single question answered, and that answer comes in the form of an email, that has a no-reply. It's impossible to troubleshoot, the customer service cannot fix anything, only escalate, and to get a problem resolved you have to start from the ground floor every time. I work for a Silicon Valley tech company, and I'm 30. I'm not someone who doesn't know how to use technology or place orders. Their system is antiquated, hands-off, and over-all offers no resolutions and horrible customer service. DO NOT order bulk company orders from Nike.",07 December 2020,US

Nat,"I ordered a pair of trainers for my daughter from Nike online on 11th November 2020 as I was getting 25% discount.  I then had to return the trainers to the Nike store on 14th November, due to them not fitting my daughter and I required an exchange to a bigger size.  I did not want to return them online as the discount was no longer available and I would have to pay full price for the exchanged pair.When I returned the trainers, they did not have a pair in the size I required in store, so would order them online for me to receive them to my home address.  When the store assistant put the return through the trainers came up with another discount code applied.  The store assistant returned £20 to my original card payment.I received my confirmation email and all looked good, but this is when the problem starts.  The delivery date I had been given on my email had been and gone.  I contacted Nike online and I was told that they were processing the order and it should be with me in the next couple of days, this was plausible as of this time of year and due to us being in a second lockdown, people were ordering more online.  That date came and gone to.  The order number I had been sent did not work online when trying to track the order, and when I contacted the store, I was told to contact head office.I then contacted Nike by telephone as I thought it would be better to talk to someone rather than messaging someone to explain my situation, I was on the telephone for 30 minutes and again I was told that there had been a delay with the order, and I would receive them by the following week.  I was getting fed up, and Nike had another discount code which I could use against the trainers that my daughter wanted for Christmas, I purchased the trainers again applying the discount code even although I had still not received my original pair.  Again, my new delivery date had come and gone, so I contacted Nike again via online, and again I was told that there had been a problem with the order and it was due to the item being out of stock...which was strange as I had already received the pair that I had ordered the day before without any issues.  I explained this to the customer service advisor and explained that I do not think that I will receive the trainers and would like my money refunded which she was happy to do and I received an email confirming that the order had been cancelled and if there was any refund due, I would receive it.  I am still waiting on a £40+ refund for a pair of trainers I have not received.  This was on the 28th November the refund was put through and it should take 5-7 days for the refund to be returned to my bank account, but I am still waiting...Absolute disgrace and I have lost all faith in a well known company!!!",05 December 2020,GB

Lisa Perry,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced! They owe me a refund! I sent some trainers back straight away due to being too big. I have all the proof I sent them back - photos, emails, Proof of purchase , tracking etc.. but as they did not send me an order number, I could not provide them this when I returned the shoes. They told me this would be ok, as long as I sent proof that I had returned the shoes (which I have). So I sent all my proof by email to Nike Assist and then waited for a month or so. Now after phoning them again the idiot on the phone has decided I can’t get a refund as I don’t have an order number. He wouldn’t let me speak to someone else or a manager. So basically they are left to their own devices to be rude and unhelpful. For a billion $ company the service Nike provides is shockingly bad. No one has ever replied to my email. Most Retail  companies reply back within a few days. Nike - get your customer service team sorted and give me my refund!!",03 December 2020,GB

I went to the store they told me to call customer service as they would be able to give me a gift receipt. How wrong I was. I was going round and round in circles with them and to top it off management refused to call me back to speak to me themselves!! This is appalling behaviour.

__,"30677171 Terrible. My order was not placing though and I had a screenshot of the time error message. I spent hours trying to place it through multiple times and as I was calling in the cyber Monday deal expired. they had corrected the 25 percent they said but transferred me to the supervisor to apply an additional inconvenience discount. 'Sebastian' the supervisor was so disrespectful. He would interrupt me and talk over me in his way of trying to get me to shut up before I could explain the issue it seems. He didn't even ask me to explain what was going on. He would manipulatively talk for a long time in an attempt to try to throw me off and make me forget what I was trying to say. I didn't get a full sentence in without being attempted shut down and getting pissed off. I was reading him the error code and he cut me off to pretend like he could not hear it. He concluded that because I was trying to talk over him and his authority and would not be grateful, that therefore he would not give me any discount and would not allow my order to process through, after the previous rep placed it through. that he would hang up in 30 secs. He said to email him proof that I had been trying to place an order hours ago which I would email him once he emailed me. I never got an email. Basically lied to me on the phone and then recorded down something else. The next customer rep said he wrote down in his notes that I would not be allowed to call back after he said that Nike was closing the night before. A way to manipulate me into not being able to be helped. He put down in the notes that there would be no more service regarding this issue. None of the following supervisors would speak to me after calling multiple times. I was squeezed out of being offered any service whenever I called. Basically, he used his authority to silence me and shut me out/down so i wouldn't be able to voice my problems. I don't even know if that's allowed. Had I known I going to be put through this much CRAP I would've never ordered on Nike in the first place and will not again. The customer service supervision is just so upsetting and not acceptable. I am not willing to sign on to any of the brand deals you guys are offering me since then. I don't want anyone else to be treated like that. He was trying to get rid of me, not playing on my team, they clearly had the ability to make my experience better and instead decided to find loopholes to hurt me. I stopped calling because not one person was willing to listen to what I was trying to say, they would say I am not allowed to speak to you anymore before I was allowed to speak at all. I was just trying to buy a nice pair of shoes on Cyber Monday. So much wasted time and energy and In the end nothing was resolved and my corrected order was not even placed through. It just was so upsetting, I'm confused. Is this the company culture that Nike embodies? Disappointing. The service is just so so bad and undermining don't think it's worth the shoes honestly.",02 December 2020,US

Emma L,I have tried to order trainers from Nike four days on a run during the Black Friday weekend. Payment gets declined. One customer service agent suggested it was a problem with my bank- contact d bank and they said my card was fine. The advisor said they would honour a 25% when I ordered even if the promotion had finished plus another 10% because of the messing round I had. Said the note would be on the system in my account. Again phoned and not only would they not honour the discount of 10% but the order did. It go through again. The representative asked for the whole of my card number too along with expiry date and Ccv. I did give it to her but still declined and worries that the representative now had my bank details.  Ended up phoning credit card to block my card for security.Still no trainers! Terrible customer service. If I could give 0 stars I would,01 December 2020,GB

I made a purchase on October 11, it should have been delivered on October 15-26. Now it’s December 1, 2 months since I have made a purchase, and it hasn’t been sent yet. I used to get answers once a week or so and now nobody answers me at all! No one gives me any estimations when the delivery will take place. Moreover, no one tries to solve this issue from Nike’s side, they tell me contact their delivery partners and figure out what has happened by myself. Nonetheless I did it too. And the delivery partner said that this is Nike who is responsible for the delay. They say the parcel has not been declared for arrival yet. Will never buy anything there",01 December 2020,BY
Alin Rosca,"I've ordered some Jordans from Nike.com on 30th September and my order got stuck in their NL Warehouse since then. In last month I've spoken every week with the customer support department, each agent told me the same story, that their finance department has to approve the request and they have to answer in 5-7 working days. Even if every time I call them, they can see that those days have passed several times, they just add a comment to that case and nothing is happening.I should read more carefully all other reviews about how Nike doesn't give a s**t about customers.",01 December 2020,GB

Roger,"Good trainers but terrible customer service, definitely not a world top company. First time using their website to order online and it was terrible, do not try.Ordered a pair of trainers, got confirmation of dispatch and never got the product. After 10 days contact their chat centre and they said the order was lost that I would have to reorder if I wanted the trainers but they were out of stock. Not only I didn't get the trainers for the event I needed them for but I missed on buying another products during black friday sale.Their customer service didn't offer any sort of solution to this and added another unhappy customer to their record.

Lou Allen-Mirehouse,"Terrible customer service. Placed an order 19 days ago, no sign of it, I have contacted customer services 5 times and each time I have been fobbed off (one even said the hold up was due to a traffic jam!) Eventually gave up and tried to cancel  my order this morning but was told it would take another two weeks to ""request a cancellation"" and the rep then hung up on me. Madness! Why have ""customer service"" if they don't actually do anything to help the customer?!",30 November 2020,GB
Wendi Thorne,"Ordered a pair of trainers - payment was taken, confirmation email received then nothing for 8 days when I got an app notification saying my order was cancelled - zero explanation!These were for going on holiday in two days time...Thanks Nike.

Tick man,"Where do I start I'm absolutely furious with this company, I am appalled with the way I've been treated with a number of transactions also seeking information and being told wrong information by colleagues on the phone. Being kept on hold for 20-minutes to 40 minutes at a timecredit to people that have pay-as-you-gos My phone bill is nearly come to £74 trying to sort out issues with incompetent staff that only seem to want to infuriate me so they can terminate the call early so they don't have to deal with me. This disgusting company has accused me of having fraudulent activity on my account but I know 1000% that I haven't committed any kind of fraudulent activity it's a total lie to try and cover their selves from their mistakes ,i wasting more money on the phone being held in queues to find out what the situation was,untold a number of times that you will receive a manager call back in a set time and it didn't happen, thenI'm finally called back by a manager called Adam who i have spoke to before a number of times he has come to the phone with no information to give me or hasn't spoken to me so another mistake on your part, it doesn't take any idiot to work out if someone is ringing up with an issue and you know of it issue then you need to speak to the irrelevant people before you get back to the customer that is making the complaint, this disgusting company has made me worry now that my account and my credit card details are open to fraud and they will not explain what is going on,and they won't explain what is going on because they know nothing has gone on ,they just want to try and get me off of their system because I have put them in their place and shut them down with every mistake they have made and they don't like it.if you're going to have people on your reception answering phones to the public then they should know the right information to tell them not get annoyed when customers tell you how to run their business and how certain things work. I am 46 and have spent a lot of money over the years on products from Nike and this is the respect I  get. Made up accusations that they don't want to clear up. so how safe is people's details how safe is my credit card information now if they won't explain what has happened. They are crooks ,and by the looks of it your information is not safe either. how can somebody accuse you of something are you but not explain why,would any of you or your staff members like to be accused of a crime that you haven't done and I know the answer is no. All I can do is put every single phone call every single video that I have made on to the internet where everybody can wise up about this company Nike. That seems to lie and cheat their way through and discriminate against the disabled. This is not about the money I have lost this is about the principal and I am going to do everything in my power to shame your company on a daily basis, and seek legal representation around the situation and take this disgusting company to court, for committing fraud against me and for also for defamation of character. You have picked on the wrong little person . and the reason I am more infuriated is because I have done absolutely nothing to be treated in this way.  Amateurs but haven't got a clue what they're doing ,turning people's lives upside down accusing them of criminal activities with no proof whatsoever how dare you. And the crazy thing is I still don't know if my credit card or my address is safe. So people be wise when you're using this company. As for the old deal that I have been put through people be very mindful. And I don't even want to give one star. With the amount of followers I have this story is surely going to reach many people. DISGUSTING LIARS",28 November 2020,GB

They took my money and after 9 days nothing had arrived, after I contacted customer service and a long hour later they admitted the shoes where lost in transit.

NR Newcastle,"As others have said, Nike seem to be stealing money. I made an order with them today. Seconds later, a duplicate order was placed - not by me. However, both amounts of money have been logged on my bank account. I tried to cancel one - can't. I contacted customer services (Jhan) who said ""don't worry, you can return the duplicate then you'll get a refund"". They just didn't get that the money had been taken without authorisation and that it wasn't acceptable practice. Within minutes it was impossible for me or them to cancel an order - this can't be right? How was a duplicate order made without me authorising payment? Something is very wrong with their systems and I won't be shopping with them again. I emailed the Nike address on the paypal receipt only to find out it doesn't exist!

Nora,"Let me start my message with the fact that use Nike for long time, clothes, accessories. And for long years I was totally satisfied and glad to find a reliable manufacturer with high quality.However it recently changed. I feel frustrated, disappointed and don`t see how/when it will be resolved. I bought a Nike Vaporfly 4% running shoes in January. After not even 10 months of using it and having 1000km, the tread started falling apart from the rest of the shoes and it started feeling inconvenient during running. I believe it would be pretty expensive to spend over 230 GBP on yearly basis for a new pair of shoes or if this is Nike's strategy then I made a mistake with the original purchase.After I get in touch with Customer Service Team who advised to return it back to the Store, who will manage inspection and issue a refund. More weeks after the shoes had been delivered to the return address, I didn't receive any update at all. I called the `Store` number where a gentleman asked me to provide evidence of the return regardless I told that the status of the order on Nike website clearly said that has been received by Nike on the 4th November.The gentleman said they will proceed with the refund but nothing happened. I just keep calling them. So far I can't see any update on the website or received anything via email which i was told i will.Since I don`t have a running shoe for 3 weeks, I decided I will give it a try and order another type hoping to have “longer life”. I checked the size details of my previous shoe in cm (Vaporfly) and I ordered a Pegasus 37 in the same size. I received it and that was small regardless of the cm written on the website said the same as the other. I returned this straight afterwards and did a photo again if any evidence will be required for this return too and just hope now that the refund will be processed for that at least on time and will receive update and refund for the vaporfly as well.Other frustration that I couldn't find any contact information where I can send escalation / complaint and ask support.",25 November 2020,GB

Chris,"No really, listen to the recent reviews. Let me be clear, I'm a Nike product fan. Their shoes suit me well and I have some of the gym clothes too. And usually, the quality is top marks.I bought their shoes recently and got them pretty much within a couple of days. Excellent. A short while later, a family member asked me to order them shoes. I did, with the order due to arrive 6 days after. However, it did not turn up and 7 days after that date, it still appears to have not even shipped out yet. I 'chatted' this morning with a rep and they said they'd send the cancellation email but they have not. Second attempt, I got to 5th in the queue and was booted off. I'm now on my third attempt to get into contact with customer service to cancel the shoes. Impressively, it's after closing time and I'm still in the queue. Not sure for how long though! This is utterly ridiculous.",23 November 2020,GB
MPCpl,"I recently had to return a pair of trainers as they were faulty. The fault was accepted and the return process was really smooth. When I had bought the shoes there was a promo on which meant I got about £30 off, with faulty items they let me know they can only offer a straight refund and not a replacement but this has meant I'm now having to pay the full price to replace a faulty item. They said a price match wasn't available as it was after 30 days, but a fault is a fault and I do no feel the time frame should apply in this instance, I could understand if it was a regular return. I have good faith in Nike hence why I am happy to order the shoe again, but it really shows that the company don't care too much about customer satisfaction or doing the right thing by the customer. I am left feeling disappointed and more cautious of Nike as a company. Very happy to say that all customer service agents were polite, helpful and timely!",23 November 2020,GB

David Pehrson,"On November 10th my credit card was used for an unauthorized purchase for an Apple Watch 500 ish dollars. My credit card company informed me and I did not make this charged. We canceled the card and they removed the charge. I thought that was it. I then received a call from a local fedex trying to find out about a package that had my name on it. They said it was from Nike and that they had several calls to forward the package and attempts to pick it up. I thought that I would DO THE RIGHT THING. I went down and picked up the package so that Nike would not loose this watch. Now is where everything goes down hill. Call 1. I called Nike and explained what had happened and after 20 min on the phone the call was dropped. Call 2 next day I called again and they said thank you for getting this and they sent me a label to take it to the shipping company. I thought I would be done. I went to the fedex drop off and they wanted me to pay to ship the watch back. I told them this was NOT what Nike said. Why would I pay to ship a product I never ordered. I gave them grace it must be a mistake. Call 3 same thing for another 30 min of my life. The lady assured me it was good to go. I printed off the second label and took it this time to UPS. Same thing is I pay them to ship it back. Now I am PISSED OFF. I spent the last 3 days trying to do the right thing and all I get is same results. I call back from the ups store thinking again it’s a mistake and go through another 40 min call. He said the system needed an hour to generate a shipping label. It is now 12 hours and no shipping label. Nike customer service people were all very nice but I still have a package that I never ordered. With all the time, effort and frustration I am done with tying to get this watch back to you. If you want it back call me and explain why you are such a ZERO in customer service.",22 November 2020,US

Their processes just do not work to resolve issues. If it wasn't for the fact I have a gift card I would never order from them again.",10 November 2020,GB
JC,"Nike i purchased 2 pairs of sneakers over $300.00 and i received 1 shipment and not the other. I've called Fedex who tells me to call Nike and it's a back and forth thing just to get sneakers redelivered to my correct address. Fedex says that Nike put a hold status on my sneakers and when i call Nike to ask that they call Fedex to redeliver the package it's excuse after excuse. 1 rep said the new policy is the customer must call Fedex but when i called they said only the Shipper can call to make the request. I also hear that some drivers don't ring people's bells so the package can be delivered if they have a lot of routes to do so they leave notices which is so unfair. I called Nike almost 7 times between the hours of 3pm and 8pm and the same amount for Fedex to be told I should get an email in 2-5 business days telling me what can be done to get my other pair of sneakers. For all I care Fedex can send them back to you and refund me my money. Nike needs to get it together with how they ship and how they handle customer concerns because right now i don't feel like a happy customer. After all I went through to be held, someone will contact me back. I'm very dissatisfied.",10 November 2020,US
Dave Haslam,"I have been a size 9 for over 20 years, so I order two pairs of shoes in a size 9 and both are too small!I contact Nike and arrange for a 9.5 to be sent and they send a 10! I try again to arrange for the correct size to be sent and they have now sold out! They hadn't sold out yesterday when the shoes were delivered, but guess who doesn't open on a Sunday, even though you can still buy off the site etc??The customer service reps can't do their jobs properly or even know their jobs. We had TWO agents give us a partial refund on other shoes that we bough for our children as they were faulty, but when I ask for a partial refund on my shoes so I can buy a new inner sole to make the shoes wearable. ""we can't do partial refunds"", that isn't what your emails and other agents say!!AVOID AT ALL COSTS. CHEAP SHOES AT PREMIUM PRICES.",09 November 2020,GB

CMAC,"I placed my order, only to read all these negative reviews afterwards. I really regretted my decision and contemplated cancelling. I then decided to hold off and give them a chance. I'm glad I did, as the stuff arrived today in an extremely timely manner, and my trainers and top are of the highest quality. Unless I am an anomaly (in a good way) I can't really understand all these negative reviews. I sadly felt obligated to come on and give them a positive review, or at the least show everyone that it is possible to get good results with Nike.",02 November 2020,GB

They kept telling me that they will process it. Till Date (2 months done) i did not get my money and contacted them again, and they said they have no trace about the returned product (the same product they said they recieved and i also have an aramex link showing its delivered to them)BE VERY CAREFUL!

Kate K,"Nike UK online store does not pay refunds on time. They blatantly break UK Law by withholding refund for already returned goods much longer than legally allowed 14 days. Do not buy unless you're sure, you may not see your money back for a long long time. Their Customer care will tell you that they're on it, that someone will call you and that the issue will be resolved soon, but that doesn't seem to be true.

Disappointed customer,I ordered 2 coats for my son a week ago. Expecting delivery today only to receive an email to say my order was delayed. No further information or expected delivery date given. Rang customer service. My order is still in the warehouse but they don’t know when it will be picked up and despatched to me. So I have no idea if or when my order will arrive. Very disappointing. Not what you expect from a big brand name. Ordered more sports clothes from Sports Direct and JD Sports 2 days ago and both orders have already been despatched to me! Far better service!,27 October 2020,GB

Called to have my original order shipped to me and they offered a refund to be issued once I send the pair of socks and cheap shorts back to them. Hardly sounds like they are abiding by consumer law - not sending out or fulfilling an original order and then refusing a full immediate refund or just a replacement sent out. Absolutely disgusting service and will not be shopping with Nike in the future. (Mind you i was purchasing 3-4 times a year) they do not value their customers and do not rectify their own errors.",25 October 2020,AU

Contacted Nike today by using their Consumer Services Chat to be told that the order is 'stuck' in one of their warehouses and I can cancel the order for a refund and then reorder, I asked if the trainers were out of stock and if this could be the reason for delay, trainers are still in stock but just stuck, if I reorder them they would be sent to the right warehouse, or I could wait to see if there is any movement within the next couple of days. I am not at all satisfied with this response, when I mentioned that I do not understand how this order is stuck and can not be sent on to another warehouse, I received a crap response of 'let me make this more clearer'. Why should I have to go through the process of requesting a refund, waiting for this to be received and then having to reorder and the item then possibly being out of stock in the size required when the item is in stock!. Awful customer service in my opinion",23 October 2020,GB

Mrs S,Bought these in July and the soles didn't even last 9 weeks before they wore through.  Took them back to JD Sports who claimed wear and tear and wouldn't change/refund even although I had the receipt. Aren't you supposed to wear trainers?Contacted Nike customer services who couldn't/wouldn't help because I didn't buy direct from them.Poor customer services for poor quality goods.Paid less for trainers that lasted a lot longer.

I have sent feedback and complaints to Nike multiple times and they ignore and do not reply. I tried phoning them and I eventually got through to a very helpful lady.

Talked to 3 different people over the chat on their website and all said the refund was issued and would arrive on my account within a few days. Still no refund. Asked to transfer me to their supervisor — apparently, there are no available supervisors according to customer service...Overall, I have to say that besides being defected, the shoes did not feel or look like anything more impressive than a cheaply made pair from a Chinese market. I had to go to Adidas and buy myself a new pair because I simply didn't have any patience left to deal with Nike... and you know what? Those Adidas shoes are the best training shoes I've ever bought.

MD,"I am extremely disappointed in these shoes. They cost $250 and my son wore them for less than 3 months and the bubbles at the bottom are all broken.  The top of the shoes is light white and grey colour so still in mint condition but the bottoms are all wrecked. I can support my review with documents to prove this is a genuine review. My son’s shoe size is 12. He is 16 years old. We purchased these shoes in December before his ACL surgery on Feb 18, 2020.  In March, we were in COVID lock down. He is still recovering from his surgery and he is not cleared for any sports or intense physical activity. Needless to say he did not have the opportunity to wear his shoes very much. But the bubbles are damaged and in one of the bubbles a rock was stuck. I wish I could attach a photo to show you this.  So I had to spend another 250, this time I bought him adidas shoes (no bubbles) as he has to have good support when he steps. He cannot step on deflated bubbles. I will try to take them to a shoe maker as the top is still brand new, but this may be challenging to fix due to bubbles. Very disappointed, for something that is this expensive. They definitely lost 4 customers, because as long as I am paying no NIKE shoes. Also they are impossible to reach, so I came across this website to leave a review.",11 October 2020,CA

Kumar,"Ive never written a bad review about a company till today. Its because usually i’m quite forgiving especially when they express regret for the customer receiving a poor experience. But with my recent two online shopping experiences with nike, i was so flabbergasted that not only did they screw up my order once but on the second order they promised to price match and they didnt process the rebate. When questioned the response was that there will be no refund (even though I saved a copy of the service consultant promising the price match). After that they basically said if I wasnt happy I could return the shoes for a refund less the international transaction fees paid and likely the credit card charges i will incur. When i asked to speak to supervisor, I was told they would call me back when the supervisor was free. Its been a week....Update 23 Nov:Still no call from supervisor... they now understand they do need to give me a refund, but still no refund in sight.... its been 2 months and endless promises of a refund and still no cash",07 October 2020,AU

My order is still “preparing to be dispatched”. Fair, I understand due to COVID-19 there will be delays but to have waited this long for one of my Nike orders is really unacceptable really. I’m in curiosity of what the staffs at the warehouses are doing. Working by sitting on a sofa and watching TV in their warehouses? LOL. Didn’t happen last time I ordered, just had to happen on a pair of sweatpants that I really want.",30 September 2020,GB
Hannah LaMew,"I created a Nike account in march and picked out TWO specific pairs of air force ones and favorited them that same day and they didn't have my size. Then for 7 MONTHS, I checked every single day waiting for them to restock my size and they never did. They would restock only one size like once every other month and it was always the worst size that no one wears. After a while, I picked three different pairs to narrow down since I figured the shoes I wanted were never gonna come back in stock. Today I realised that all the pairs I picked only had SIZE 18 AVAILABLE. I contacted costumer service to ask them when the shoes are going to be restocked since I start in-person school in a week and a half and need new shoes and their response was ""I don't know, you should favorite them so you can check to see if they restocked your size"" LIKE DUDE IVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SEVEN MONTHS. and I told them that and they responded with ""hope you get them!"" like............. wth. terrible",30 September 2020,US

When I contacted them, I was told that they’re no longer in stock. Why not tell me that rather than lead me to believe I had purchased something?Decided to order the trainers from another retailer, but all of a sudden, the ones from Nike show up! Next thing I know, they withdraw the money from my bank, leaving me short until next payday. If it wasn’t for the terrible organisation, they’d be going back. Never again.",30 September 2020,GB

Carl Thompson,We purchased a pair of Nike Tempo firm ground football boots. After three football matches and 4 training sessions. The sole was coming away from the uppers.

Matthew,"I have been a loyal Nike member since 2013 and ordered many of times over the years. I placed an order on the 31st August 2020 for a pair of trainers, which I paid with a gift voucher and applied a 25% promo at the time. 8th September I received an email to notify of delay in order due to stock. After speaking to several people, asking when it would be dispatched, they offered an extra 15% off as a gesture. (Acceptable at the time) however to this day it was still stuck 'In progress' when they had already put stock back on their website. 1 agent said they would email the warehouse to process the order quickly. Another agent told me they couldn't email the warehouse? I was also told that delayed orders are prioritised over new orders, but then another agent stated from their experience, cancelling the order and reordering again would be quicker!? I asked if a manager could call me to discuss the issue, as I cannot believe in 2020 no one can simply put a call/email into the warehouse to speed up a delivery which has been delayed significantly. Never received a call after being promised someone would call me on either the Saturday or Monday just gone. No emails received either. I then decided to call today to simply cancel the order and reorder, to my annoyance that I was told that they cannot honour the 25% promo code again but would have to reimburse, once Ive paid full price!? The worst part of this experience which topped it for me, I spoke to Ryan today, who in all my years of interaction with a customer service rep, have I spoke to someone who is so rude and confrontational. I was gobsmacked by his tone of voice, which was aggressive and he assumed upon previous notes, (He was very quick to tell me notes his colleague left). I am still shocked by the way he spoke to me. He is based in Dublin/Ireland where most of their customer service is. I have now cancelled and left short of order. - Goes well if stocks in place but if something delays, be prepared for a nightmare. If you want Nike products i would go via 3rd Parties and not direct because their clearly is no consequence for staff who act inappropriately.",25 September 2020,GB
Chibai Seet,"Absolutely horrible. Within 30mins i have requested to change a simple shipping address however, their lousy system took hours to process it. I was met by extremely poor customer service when i asked on how to change this. Ghosting, attitude problems and being told i was rude by using ""w,t,f"" being told off for profanities. First chat, ernie, simply couldnt do anything since it was not processed. Ok. 2nd chat, Mary, just left me hanging after asking for my details. Fine. The 3rd and most horrible one, Troy, immediately just gave me a stern reply of ""NO"" and scolded me for not reading their ""30min rule"". He then told me that ernie, from chat 1, had educated me one these rules, where in reality, he did nothing.TLDR: Nike customer service has alot of nincompoops who does not seem to know what a customer is, or how to use their own system.",24 September 2020,SG
Alex,"Before you go ahead and buy anything from Nike.com, you should know that you have ""30 minutes"" only to cancel or change size. So by any chance (like me) if you order the wrong size the customer service will tell you ""sorry we can't do anything"".. I literally contacted them to cancel my order or allow me to change the size 1 hour after my order online and what they told me was mind blowing. You can't!.. You have to wait to receive order then go through post office to return to them! Then only you get your refund. This is the most ridiculous rule i have ever seen. They even suggest me to refuse to accept the parcel. I mean what kind of idiotic company have such moronic policy in this era. Every online shop do their best to make customers happy. I am extremely disappointed and will never ever buy directly from NIKE. They simply do no give a ""Damn"" about customers. They are probably too big to care.I'd suggest finding a nike dealer shop online and buy from them instead. At least you are entitled to some customer service.",23 September 2020,SG

Adrian D,"Worst experience ever.I have bought a pair of Nike Wildhorse-6 on 28 Jul 2020 with 60 euros at a promotion, with an estimated time of delivery between 02 August and 09 August. On 6 of August, I have asked information from support to see what happened to it, and they said that the package didn't leave the warehouse and provided a tracking number with the promise to ship the package the immediately. On 09 August the package was still not shipped and went to ask info again. They said that they will investigate and that I will receive a response on the email in 3 days max. On 12 of August I have not received any response and went back to support where they told me that in another 3 days max I will receive an answer. On 15th of August I haven't received any response and went again to support where they told me that there was a problem with the order, and they cannot ship it. However, I have the option to have the money refunded and to order again, but at a price of 120 euros, as the promotion was not active anymore. I told them that if I can order again the pair, it means that the shoes are available in the warehouse, and they can send the original order. They said that they cannot do that and I have then asked for a manager to provide me with an official answer that they cannot send me the shoes that I bought with a price due to an issue on the warehouse, but they can send the same pair if I pay double the price. The manager told me that she will refund the first order, I need to order again and to pay the full price while she will match the price and refund the difference. She even gave me a case number for reference. I agreed, and I have received the package 28 of August and the first refund on 30 August. I have waited for the second refund until today, 8 September but after no sign of getting the money I have contacted the support. The agent told me that they had an issue in their program and the refund was not performed. Well, isn't there a person who verifies if things are done at the end of the day? It appears not and I have again asked for a manager to inform me what would happen if I didn't contact them to ask about the refund. The agent said that the manager is not available, and they promised that I will receive a proof of the refund and a statement on the email in 3 days. Yeah, right.Works experience ever with this online shop. Luckily, I have the transcripts of all the conversations with them and I can prove it.",08 September 2020,RO

I've call 3 times about a purchase I never made and it is clear as freakin day that it was sent to a different location from were i have been living for 14yrs. Your company policy states it was an authentic order and if i want my money back I have to return the product. How can I return a product I never received nor did I order to know what it was to even return. You know who ordered the product why not charge them? go after them? since they technically didn't pay for YOUR products and just return the money that is mine that your customer used to fraudulently pay for your products. It's blatantly clear this company runs on absolute greed and fraud and doesn't care about actual justifiable facts.

I looked at the unisex version that was £7 more expensive, so even with the code i'd still be spending more than i did on the shoes that were never in stock? and now i have to wait 8-14 days for a refund.TL;DRordered shoes that turned out were out of stock, took them 28 days to tell me and only because i kept nagging, now having to return them. was given 10% good will discount to spend on their website. basically the same shoes i didnt get are £7 more expensive than the ones i ordered.",01 September 2020,GB

Last week I again asked for it to be cancelled,lovely lady who said she would add me to the list of cancellation requests, yesterday I asked if it had definitely been cancelled and when should I expect my refund so I can purchase from elsewhere, told the money isn't taken until item despatched it's just held in authorisation and to expect it in my available funds within 5-12 days....fair enough, asking again if it's definitely been cancelled and no response!!The whole time it's been sat in my orders and it's progress has been listed as 'Unknown' I still don't know if it's actually been cancelled, so frustrating.

Ordinarydude,So I returned my trainers early August and was told the refund had been put through.  2 weeks later no sign of it and they said it hadn’t gone through (although no-one got in touch to tell me this).  It’s dubious to say the least as no retailer has had an issue refunding to my credit card before.  They told me someone would be in touch to take my payment details.  I waited a week and nothing.  So phoned again and made a fuss and someone called me about 2 hours later.  They took my bank account details for some reason.  A week later it’s still not appeared so will give it a few more days and then phone again..All the customer service staff have been polite but it seems that they quietly operate a system where they actively avoid giving refunds to customers in the hope that they’ll give up and walk away (I won’t!).Very poor.,27 August 2020,GB

John Falkner,I ordered 2 pair of air max command red and black shoes. Due to covid I ordered online. The size 10 that I ordered for myself are very nice but when they were made someone put the wrong size insoles in and my toes hang over the front. I really like the shoes but they hurt my feet although I do try to wear them from time to time they are one of the best shoes I own. I bought them on May 3rd and haven’t been able to bring to store because the stores had just finally started opening. All I really need is a size 10 insoles. Thanks. Please contact me if their is anything you can do to help me with this issue.,24 August 2020,US
Anna M,"I ordered two pairs of trainers on 23rd June, I sent them back as unfortunately neither were the right size and the size and colour I wanted was now out of stock. 17th June I received a refund notification for one pair but not the other. I have now called Nike customer service on 6 separate occasions, they have asked me to email them a copy of my bank statement then claimed not to receive it, I have also had 2 online chat conversations with them. Each time they say they will 'escalate' my case and someone will be in touch and then never are, it is now over a month since I should have received my refund and nothing. The amount is close to £100. Some of the customer service team have been very rude and aggressive, others have been nice, helpful and apologetic but then been cut off on several occasions and not called back. I have now wasted hours on this and there is still no sign of my money?! Will never be purchasing from Nike again which is a shame because I love the products. Shocking way of dealing with customers from such a large company.",24 August 2020,GB
Bing Chen,"Worst experience I've ever had with a retailer. I'm a Nike plus member and they sent me a special members-only promotion where if I purchase 150+ on an order, I would receive a $75 off promo code for a future purchase. So I made an order. When I received the order, I needed to exchange an item for a different size but they were having server issues and could only do the exchange as a refund + buy separately. I asked if doing that would affect my promotion eligibility, MULTIPLE people assured me it would not. One of them even asked a supervisor and said I was still eligible. The day I was supposed to receive the promo code, I didn't get it. I called them and they gave me a time frame to receive the code, saying X date would be the last day they send out the codes. It gets closer to the deadline and I call again, they tell me to wait until the X date, saying if I don't receive it till then, I should give them a call. Then it passed the deadline and I didn't get my code, so I called and they start telling me the X date was actually the last day to USE the code (contradicting the previous statements saying the X date was the last day to receive the code). After talking with a few more people, eventually their excuse became: only a select random number of people who participated in the promotion would get the code, and I just wasn't selected. This last part really got me, because that was not AT ALL what the initial invite said, nor was it in the fine print. At this point, this whole experience felt like some sort of promotion scam and I've pretty much just been lied to for about a whole month. If they had just told me from the start I wasn't getting the promo code, I wouldn't have wasted so much time and money on them. So I guess the lesson here is, next time I see some too-good-to-be-true promotion in my email inbox, I should just send it straight to the trash.",23 August 2020,US

Taylor Lipps,"I would rate Nike online services a zero if I could. They. Are. Beyond awful. They are disrespectful in the sense I don’t get my questions asked. I ordered a pair of shoes on the 4th of August, they some home lost them on the way to FedEx... so they were going to send me a second pair for free with 2 day air shipping. That was on the 11th... still haven’t received the shoes. Then on the 12th they charged me yet again. So two charges on one pair of shoes that I ordered almost a month Ago!!! They sent an email saying they were sending a refund. Never got it. Then was on chat with someone today and they said there was never a refund put in. Since the 11th I’ve been disconnected 3 times from 3 different people and haven’t had any of my questions answered. I have screen shot’d the conversations with two of the individuals that were no help. One lady said she was going to talk to her “team” about my refund then the next message she sent was “have a great rest of your day and thanks for being a nine customer”.... More like just lost a customer after the rude inconsiderate Nike chat “team” I’ve had to deal with for a month. They’ve irritated me to the point I want to report them. Just do your job! And 2nd off their such a huge company they need to communicate better.  And figure their stuff out and how to send a pair of shoes ON TIME, answer questions from customers, and follow through with things promised to those customers. That’s all... not freaking hard.",22 August 2020,US

I have received no communication at all from Nike so I am not a happy customer. I have emailed them this morning but perhaps I should have listened to all the bad reviews on here.

Lauren,"Order timelines are not accurate at all. I ordered through this website In July based on their quoted shipping timelines. I’ve been waiting several weeks to receive my order. When it did not show up I contacted their customer service chat feature. They had no idea there was an issue with the delivery date displayed on their website and suggested another 5-7 delay while they look into this. At that point they would provide me with a third shipping date. I asked for another solution and they talked me in circles saying “no worries”. I had to call customer service and talk to them for 20 minutes before speaking to someone who was able to place a return to sender request. If this is not successful I’ll have to wait for the profit to arrive (it’s currently in the USA still and I’m in Canada) before setting up a return. I’ll then have to wait for the product to arrive back through the USA, run through QA in their warehouse and have the refund processed. DO NOT TRUST THIS WEBSITE.",14 August 2020,CA

Bella De Silva,"As Nike sponsor the Premier League, I cannot continue to buy, wear (and therefore advertise) their brand. The PL is rife with corruption and greed and favoritism. An historic and loyal football club are being treat with complete disregard, and furthermore, so are the fans and the people who live in the city the club represents. A takeover was set to happen, after 13 years of ownership by a man who only wanted profit without spending, by a consortium that were happy and willing to invest not only in the club, but the region. This region will be hit the hardest economically after the current pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of hard working people are already at risk of burn out just trying to make ends meet and it is only going to get worse. The proposed investment would have meant massive progress for the economy, but also jobs, housing and schools for the people who live here. The same people who buy and wear Nike products. As sponsors of the PL, you have a duty to your loyal consumers to also hold the PL to account. And you are not. You, just as the other sponsors, are sitting by idly, while real people are suffering, and will continue to suffer. We all work hard in this region, but we cannot continue to LIVE without some help or opportunity that is NEVER given up here. That opportunity has been snatched away because of the PL and their favoured teams. It becomes more and more obvious with every day of silence and ignorance, that the PL and their 'Big 6' and their other 'friends' (namely Qatar and beIN Sports - who reportedly fund terrorist organisations) are afraid of fair competition in sport. It seems to us, as Nike are also saying and doing nothing, that you are okay with this. As a sports brand, do you think it acceptable to endorse unfair competition and unsportsmanship? Is that the image you want to gain? Because that is the image you are giving to the fan base - on a global level. There are fans of that club all over the world. And fans all over the world are becoming just as digusted with the sponsors, as they are with the PL. As such, I, and many others that I have spoken to, cannot and will not continue to give Nike or the other sponsors our hard earned money, when they clearly do not care about their consumers. It is unfair and unjust and Nike are guilty by association in their continued support of the PL and their utter contempt for Newcastle United, the fans and the people who live in the city. Shame on all of you. I hope all your money brings you comfort when you remember what you have done to an entire community. I hope, that your money makes you feel human.

Tracy King,I purchased a pair of shoes and wore them for less than 2 months when they started getting a hole in the top. I'm not a runner so they don't get abused. Nike insisted they stand behind their product and have a 2 year warranty. They did nothing for me after spending $15 to send them in to be looked at. They said it was normal wear and tear. How can a show start to fall apart after less than two months?! I'll never purchase another product from Nike. They lost a LONG time customer. Extremely disappointed in the quality and Customer service.,27 July 2020,US

The rep on chat refused to acknowledge questions that she didn't like, including about 20 requests for a manager.  They have no accountability for providing good service5) The same size of shoe is actually drastically different across the different styles that they sell.

Sam,"Purchased a pair of Nike Zoom Gravity Women's Running Shoe size 8.5 at their store in Miami and the shoes were great. While traveling overseas I purchased another pair of the same exact shoe (a different color), since I wore out the first pair. Both original and new pair were size 8.5. The problem was that the new ones were noticibly larger than the original pair, even though both had the same size tag inside. I ordered the newer ones at nike.com and had them shipped to me overseas. Nike agent (and then his supervisor) informed me that nothing could be done to help me since I was not in the USA. (I was stuck overseas due to Corona virus), and thus cost of returning faulty product from this country exceeded price of shoes. Agent claimed there was nothing he could do to remedy situation and I am forced to purchase another product, which will NOT be a NIKE product.

Red Francisco,"Trash company. I understand these are different days, however Nike is no small company with plenty of resources. They showed my size shoe in stock, I ordered. The day of the delivery I actually got an email saying the shoes were not in stock and should ship in the next few days. I contacted them right away to cancel the order and was told the shoes will probably still ship to me and I'll have to ship them back for a refund. That means for almost a month they want to keep money and they want me to take my time to ship the shoes back to them. They didn't take the time to inform me of a backordered or out of stock issue untill the day the shoes should be here, and then tell me they won't ship for days, but can't stop my order? NIKE IS A JOKE! They did offer me a myriad of excuses, I wonder if they want to hear about my family problems and all the reasons I can't take time to ship them back shoes I don't want a month after ordering , or who knows how long it will really take to get them....",09 July 2020,US

I called Nike About This Issue several times and on the 19th of June I spoke to a lady who asked if I wanted the money back or the shoes. I told her I wanted my shoes she said alright she’ll put it through for a new order because most scammers would want the money back.

I jumped on a live chat with someone and they said that I would need to print an exchange label but due to Covid-19 I was unable to do this as I don't have my own printer SO, they told me to use my returns label and get proof of postage, send them the reference number and that they would trigger the exchange manually from their end. Got home, did all mentioned above and within 5 days I had my new shoes in the correct size.Staff were friendly, helpful and speedy so definitely no complaints.I also made sure to complete the Nike survey with the names of the two employees that helped me as I thought they did such a great job.",08 July 2020,GB

The whole process is easy!I can only assume that their rating on here is so low because happy and loyal customers are not leaving the positive reviews Nike deserves.,08 July 2020,GB
Dee Parker,Nike sent me a used shoe!!! Horrible,08 July 2020,US
Steven Rosenthal,CHINA CHINA CHINA.  Nike is anti American and Pro China.  Their products are made in Communist China taking away jobs from America.  And their products are absolutely the poorest quality,08 July 2020,US
D3ADHUNT3RS,Nike support is horrible! My AirMax 720 air bobble popped and they don’t wan’t to replace it... Bought them less than a year ago.,06 July 2020,CA
Stephen,I have had both great service and absolutely shocking service from Nike. I am currently locked in a Paypal dispute with them for an item I returned in May that has still to be refunded to my account. Nike claim to have refunded this amount but a check of their Paypal would see that they have not. Unbelievable one of the biggest sports companies and having to fight to get a refund from them. I would avoid buying from this company - I have been on Live Chat with them 3 times and been told i have been refunded but the refund still hast appeared. Will stick to other Sports Brands in future or at least buy from a JD or somewhere with proper customer service. As part of the Paypal review they then sent me a Chinese company address to return the item to - even though I had sent it back to them months previously.As an update I won the Paypal dispute and am being refunded but this is August and I returned the item in May - will never use this service again!! At least Paypal could see the disgusting treatment anyway and they have had to pay me - small vindication against them.,06 July 2020,GB
Emily Niamh O'Brien,"Despite the sometimes overpriced products and discount codes that don’t work, I find Nike to be a very reliable company offering high quality products.

arthur blumer,tried to return defective golf gloves recently purchased the velcro would not hold the glove closed Nike claimed a tag from the 2 gloves that i never even tried on was missing and they could not verify the manufacturer they are returning the defective gloves what a disgusting way to handle this situationi now have 3 gloves that cannot be usedafter 30 years of buying their products this is how they treat my only return i have purchased my last Nike anythingAdidas and Under Armour you have a new customer the biggest joke was when they wrote me they thanked me for the return of the SHOES i recently bought!,05 July 2020,CA
Dan,Very surprised by the many negative comments regarding Nike's customer service as I've received nothing but the absolute BEST from them in recent months! I was flabbergasted when I discovered their returns policy allowed shoes that had even been worn outside to be refunded for any reason within 30 days (now 60 days due to pandemic). Was even given a 15% discount due to recently missing out on a Nike members promotion! A⭐,03 July 2020,GB

WASHINGTON REDSKINS merchandise Native Americans don’t care and are not offended by this, it’s been proven in poll after poll over years. It’s white politicians that cry!  Native Americans don't even care about that crap man.  Not to mention the fact that it was changed from Braves to Redskins to not be confused with the Boston Braves. George Preston Marshall was racist against blacks, but the Redskins name was actually in honor of the current coach William ""Lone Star"" Dietz.

Geser Luna,I bought two pairs of Custom Nike shoes. When I receive them both of them did not look anything like how they did on the website. They where the worst quality of shoes I have ever bought! They looked like they just put glue on them and painted them with a brush really disappointed with Nike’s service!,02 July 2020,US
Gary,"Ordered 2 pairs of trainers, order was accepted, money came out my account, email confirming order and delivery date, on delivery date no delivery, I go onto my account and the order was cancelled, no reason, went onto live chat and they still wouldnt give me a reason, asked for my full name address and phone number, I had already given my name and order number but was told that wasnt enough, still dont have a reason for why my order was cancelled or why I wasnt told",01 July 2020,GB
Senpai,Nike. Why order from Nike when you have retailers in your area that sells basically the same items. Simple: They may be out of stock or not have the items your looking for. This shouldnt be a problem with Nike. Oh boy was I wrong. I wanted to order Nike space hippies but they got sold out. I tried searching for them at the Nike site or sneaker app but nothing comes up. Not even the next restock date. This disappointing,01 July 2020,IE
R MARSHALL,"Terrible customer service! I have now wasted 2 days on this - my item was faulty, I’m trying to get a refund. I think Nike’s policy is to make you wait so long you end up giving up. I did live chat 4 times (cut off / asked for more info / waiting for an emails response that never arrives...) then I tried the phone (cut off / asked for more info / waiting fro email that never arrive). A complete disaster for customer relations, especially given all the Nike items I have bought over the years. Still waiting for a response but I have zero optimism.",30 June 2020,GB
Elisabet,"I love the running shoe ""lunarglide 9"". Every search for a month now, show ""sold out"". I go to nikes homepage, thinking if they do not have the shoe, then at least they could give me some information about it. They do not have the shoe, and there is no possibility of sending them en email for a question. There is a phonenumber, but only in english(I live in Sweden). I try to call them anyway. A man answers with a natural ""hello"", so I start to speak and then I realize that an automatic voice starts to disrupt me. It is a recorded message! Then I need to listen to choices, told by 4 different automatic womens and mens voices. Then the same different voices starts to apologizing for being buzzy, constantly. I held out for 5 minutes and had to hang up because the voices were just to annoying, which is probably the idea. Nike states that they want to be an inovating company and support the community. I had a 5 min. encounter and wanted to run the other way. At least they inspired me to running! A company of this really bad customcare I have seldom spotted. Also, I presume, they have cancelled a most beloved and sought after product. Very inovating, indeed. Well, I just have to wear out my current lunarglide and then search out another company for great running shoes, because a company with such bad customcare, do not deserve any customers.",30 June 2020,SE
Mrs Campbell,I’ve purchased a pair of trainers from Nike the order said it hadn’t gone through 2 week later the funds came out my account and the trainers arrived.The trainers was sent back recorded delivery Nike are saying it was Jd who took payment when it wasn’t gas I had ordered from Nike still no refund couldn’t speak to a manager they said they could no longer deal with it so I’m £98 down Customer service was absolutely disgusting I will be taking this matter further I will never buy a Nike product again,30 June 2020,GB
Sergio,"I’ve purchased a Nike.com gift card and I think that was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made in my life. The first time I’ve ordered from them, it took a month to get my item delivered and, when it arrived, I had to return them. The return process was a nightmare as I went to their website, selected DPD pickup, they gave me a date, the courier came another day, couldn’t recognise the label, then Nike told me they don’t use DPD for returns. Really? With the refund, I’ve placed another order expected for today. The confirmation email arrived 3 days later. Because of the delay they caused, an item went out of stock and they cancelled it. They lost the other item, promised a refund that didn’t arrive. Their customer service number doesn’t work and the chat one is useless. As result, I’ve lost my money, got no item and no refund. Absolutely shocking.",29 June 2020,GB

And when they do you won't be able to cancel it anymore. They won't send you the order the day is due and all you can do is wait until they do. It doen't matter if you contact them several times.

I made orders from Nike and have waited for a minimum 1 month before receiving my orders... and I’m talking about multiple orders over the past months .... by the time I receive the items Summer will be over. I am returning EVERYTHING. Get your “stuff” together. Terrible. You aren’t the only sporting company that exists that needs to ship internationally, your competitors make you look bad.

One by one all 7 these items apparently in stock while I was wasting my time looking for stuff to buy, all apparently available in basically every size, not a single one on sale, only one new product with any potential demand, gives a 'Sorry, there does not appear to be any inventory for item name' at checkout. I had to attempt to checkout after removing one item at a time and literally ended up with 0 of them in stock. Beyond pathetic how much time their crappy system wasted for me here",27 June 2020,GB

Michael Giacobbe,"I have been trying to place an online order for the last 3 days. I have reached out to the Nike team multiple times, I have tried placing the order on multiple browsers with debit, credit, Paypal and Apple Pay. No luck. They refuse to allow me to place an order via chat or the phone. Every time I have to wait for a chat member, it takes at least 25 minutes! Longer for a phone call. And then they simply go through ""basic troubleshooting"" with you that is not helpful at all (things like ""Is your billing address correct?"") and then tell you to try again later... guess what, I tried again and again and it still doesn't work!!! I am 25 years old, I know how to code and I place online orders on a regular basis. I never have a problem. You are clearly the problem. How hard is it to get 2 pairs of shorts and a pair of slides? Absolutely embarrassing. It seems like their customer agents are typing to 5-6 people at once based on their response times to individual messages. Get your act together. Over the past few years, I have bought less Nike and more Adidas. If I can't place my order today, I give up on Nike for good. ***UPDATE: WAS NOT ABLE TO PLACE MY ORDER. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ELITE SERVICE TEAM WOULD CONTACT ME IN 3-5 BUSINESS DAYS. I WILL BE TAKING MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.",26 June 2020,US

I spoke to them again and they said it hadn't been dispatched yet but they would keep an eye on it for me. A week later I spoke to another representative and they said they weren't sure when it would be dispatched but they would send me an email within the next few days to give me an update. No email came through. Spoke to someone again and nearly a month after the original order they finally tell me the item is out of stock and they haven't been able to source the item.

Joya Del Rosso,"Hi there! I normally don't write bad reviews, but my experience with the Legend React Running shoes (that I was TOLD) were great for running, was horrible. Nike does NOT stand by their products quality!After maybe 3 months of running, the material at back of shoes was GONE. I had blisters and couldn't run in them. I sent them into the company, which meant I also had to pay for shipping, just to get a response of ""oh, it's normal wear and tear."" I called in again to express that this isn't normal wear and tear and I've had running shoes before doing the same amount of running and that weren't $140 and never had this issue. They said ""send them in again, pay for the shipping, and we 'may' reverse our answer."" Needless to say I'm just throwing the shoes out!!! This is a company that doesn't stand by it's quality! I purchased a pair of BOSE headphones, the left ear piece stopped having sound, I called the company and with no questions, they send me a PAID shipping label and sent me brand new headphones in three weeks. THIS is a company I will purchase from again....NIKE....never again. Stand by your products!!",12 June 2020,CA

They told me I had worn them (obviously) so they couldn't accept the return. They are faulty - there is a defect. Me wearing them on occasions wouldn't make the Air Bubble pop! Do they expect me to purchase footwear and keep them in the box???? They told me to contact Nike direct. I have tried Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Messenger, numerous of emails and phonecalls. I am passed from person to person, being disconnected (phone put down more like I think) . Have been told I would get a return call or email. I have waited 6 weeks and still nothing!

Firstly when you make an order you are charged the full amount, then as each item ships you are charged again for them individually. Two weeks after placing my order and having received my products I have still been double charged, with the extra charge having pushed me into an overdraft incurring extra charges. No apologies or help was made by Nike on this matter. Secondly the exchange process is drawn out and unnecessary, having to either call or enter a chat both of which have very long queues. Competitors offer a much simpler process . All in all ordering from Nike has been frustrating and a waste of a lot time.",12 June 2020,GB

I called on the 3rd of June to be told they were held up in the warehouse and had not been sent yet.

Nike says nothing except that they have been ordered and will come within a week or the next month. I have been waiting for weeks and haven't received anything.

We explained that we had not cancelled the order and now we had missed our grandsons birthday. We were told that we just had to re-order and although the person on the chat link expressed some regret was unable to to put us through to someone who could take our complaint of very poor service any further. I understand that mistakes happen but there was no process where the problem could just be resolved by sending out a new shirt.  It took some time just to get the assistant to take some personal responsibility for the problem but we would still have to re purchase the product.

Eventually, I telephoned them and they said there was an issue with my billing address so they cancelled. Never ever had this with any other supplier. It is an excuse and as someone else said there is a problem if the company cannot inform a customer that they have cancelled. I recommend never using this company ever again.

Tete Bettencourt,"Hi,I bought a Nike sneackers that were in discount, and used a flash sale promocode that they had. I was thrilled, the shoes were awesome and for a good price. After a week, I received an email saying that the order was cancelled because it was out of stock. But after only two days, a nike add popped on my phone with the same shoes and the same size I ordered! I saw on the website that they still had the sneackers I want in stock, but now I can't use the promocode cause the flash sale ended. I tried to contact them by phone, but it's useless, you have to wait for too long! I feel deceived and I don't wanna buy from their website again. What a shame!",06 June 2020,PT
Ashley Wright,"***Update - They obviously review their trustpilot page as they proceeded to re-charge my account and ship my order. Not once has anybody contacted me to explain. I'm EXTREMELY unhappy as I re-ordered from another retailer and did not give permission for them to charge my account a second time. Unprofessional and appalling from such a big company and l will be taking this higher.Cancelled my order and never bothered to tell me why or explain/apologise. Held my money for over a week and then I get a random refund out of the blue.Trying times, I understand but in 2020 to not even send a customer a courtesy email to advise why their order is cancelled is not great customer service. I expect more from such a successful brand.",06 June 2020,GB
Beata,"I have ordered shoes online. I'm willing to give two stars, because the online order process itself was super easy, and obviously not complicated. Also delivery was quick, only 6 days within Europe. However, the shoes (white Air Max 720) were delivered with brownish stains all over them. Customer service hotline not responsive, and I have been waiting for 37 minutes to speak to someone. Didn't happen in the end. No possibility to contact them via mail, so this is a major minus in Customer Care service. I would like to actually trade the pair of shoes in for a new one, but my only option is to return them, which isn't what I actually wanted to do.",05 June 2020,PL
James Latham,"This is an example of a brand that has had a bad pandemic. The online experience is good and the website is helpful. Unfortunately, the call centre and back-office processes just are not up to it. Gifts and returns require hours of calls and their ability to deliver what they offer just isn't there. Nike is a brand that I will view much less favourably going forward. Not able to cope and they don't appear to care.",05 June 2020,CA
Abdullah Shaikh,"I ordered a pair of Nike air max 720-818 and Nike air max 200 on 29th may 2020 online. At this time there was a promotional offer for 30% off everything on the store so without hesitating I bought the shoes. When I ordered I waited a bit for them to send confirmation email but it hadn't come but after 4 hours after purchasing online I got the email saying my order has been confirmed.After on the order status it showed processing order and I was thinking when they will dispatch the order (they had given me an estimated delivery time of 11 June) so I waited and yesterday I got en email they had dispatched my order.The delivery took less than 24 hours to arrive by DPD. I received the shoes this morning. So it took 7 days to come which Is reasonable and during this pandemic they had to be more careful so I didn't mind it taking long to arrive.The delivery takes 1 day after they had dispatched the item and an average of 5-6 days to process your order.The shoes are packed in it's original box with another DPD box on top so they are careful on not to damage the packaging and the shoes. They come with a free return label sticker if you want to return the shoes.The quality of the shoes feels amazing and they fit to size. Sleek, comfy and very well made. I have multiple Air Maxes and even own two pairs of the recent 720s but this pair of 720-818 is by far the nicest air maxes I ever owned. Very stylish and comfy. Looks good with almost anything. I went with the black ones and pictures does not do this shoe justice. Good job Nike for designing and creating some of the most innovative shoes on the market. I will continue supporting and wearing as long as you continue making shoes that accommodates the consumers. The shoes and the picture look identical to each other so you recieve what you buy. First off, they're absurdly comfortable. By far the most cushioning of any sneaker I've ever tried, you really sink in with every step. I think it's great but I could see it being TOO much for some people. Still, if you're looking for the ultimate in cushion, here it is. Second, the materials are really nice. The suede is soft, the leather is pretty nice and the mesh panels feel durable. The cork insole is also a nice touch and helps up the comfort. These feel like they'll hold up to a lot of wears and should still look good a little beat up. The color is also nice, muted earth tones contrast nicely with the over-the-top physical design of the show, it definitely makes the shoe feel more wearable. Fit is true to size, but on the roomier side. Overall two thumbs up.I have no idea why the other reviews are really bad, In my opinion the processing is not the fastest (Adidas delivered in 2 days (Including processing time and dispatching)) but the shoes and the packaging is on point and delivery is very fast. I will definitely order again from this site. I ordered 2 shoes to see if they will loose on of them but they did not. Both shoes were delivered by DPD but not together they both had different tracking numbers and boxes.Message to NIKE: Can you send me more discount code or good offers.",05 June 2020,GB

Scott,"Discusting service from one of the so called biggest companies in the world. Ordered an item 5 days ago today. Still no word of it being processed at least, let alone dispatched. Long waits on phone to speak to someone. Rang 3 times and its like they read from a script. Cannot answer when challenged on what they say. Asked to cancel my order as it has not even been processed yet. Was told they cannot, I will have to wait until the item comes then return it. Pathetic customer service. Make no attempt to help you or sort the problem out. If you want to get messed about and wait for an obscene amount of time for items you have spent your money on, shop here. If not avoid them. I will never, ever again buy from here. I ordered the same item from another company and it arrived at my door in 2 days. Just goes to prove what they try fob you off with on the phone is utter nonsense. Waste of time and space. Order reference C00178143419.",05 June 2020,GB
Paula Meehl,We had an order come in last week missing an item. We’ve called three times and have waited over an hr every time even tho it says wait time 20-30 minutes.  I’m not one to write reviews but for how much we spent and one of our items not actually arriving even tho it shows on the order that it was delivered really makes me made. Come on Nike we shouldn’t have this much of a problem with customer service. All we want is our product we ordered.,05 June 2020,US

Robyn Court,"Ordered never arrived!Desperately needed running trainers, ordered on 10th May. Email receipt advised delivery was expected on 28th May. A ridiculous amount of time to wait even in the current circumstances. Website never explained that the delivery time could be 2 and a half weeks. Order had been placed so I decided to go with it - my worst decision. 28th May came and no trainers. I waited until 1st June and decided to call customer services. Michael answered my call, I was put on hold a lot of times. Although I could tell Michael was trying to help, he didn't seem confident on the phone and he didn't even seem certain in the responses he was giving me. I had to constantly ask him to relay what he was trying to say. Michael had problems with his mic with a horrible piercing noise coming through the phone. Michael eventually advised that it was likely my trainers were lost in transit and therefore he would process a refund for me. I explained that I had waited 3 weeks for trainers that were never going to arrive. 3 weeks of no exercise as my current trainers had broken. I explained how annoyed i was. Michael didn't have much to say but he offered me a discount code. I explained I wouldn't be shopping with Nike again and I requested details in order to make a complaint. Michael said that this was not possible, only he could pass on my dissatisfaction. What a bizarre process. Funnily enough only Nike staff can make direct complaints about Nike services. Obviously something isn't right there and statistics of their customer service must be manipulated. An overall disappointing experience for my first Nike order; currently awaiting a refund and I won't be shopping again.",03 June 2020,GB

Dominique,"Would give 0 stars if possible. I am absolutely furious at the customer service I have received. All I wanted was a simple exchange as the shoes I ordered didn't fit right so I wanted a different size. The first time I called I was told that was ok, they will process the exchange after I return my shoes, I was told I will receive a free returns label in the post. This never came. I called a second time - apparently the exchange had never actually been processed and that they don't actually send free labels in the post. I was then told return the shoes I have with the returns label already provided and they will send me the new pair. This never happened. So I call a THIRD time and after being on the phone for well over an hour, get told since I returned them and have been refunded I can no longer get the exchange. I am fuming. Out of 'goodwill' Nike gave me a 20% discount code which when I entered it still works out to me paying more for the shoes than what I originally paid so what was the point? Hugely disappointing as this is the first time Ive ever ordered from Nike and to receive this terrible customer service where 2 of their workers clearly don't know how to process an exchange...its so frustrating. I did not expect this from such a huge brand as Nike so I am genuinely surprised, angry, disappointed and upset.",03 June 2020,GB

Harry,"I really want to give 0 star to Nike.comMy first order was cancelled after 4 days, the reason is out of stock. Spent time ordered a different pair of trainers, would you believe they cancelled order again after another 5 days for the same reason, shocking! I can't believe they are so out of date on technology, looks like their live stock database is not linked with website, basically you are more likely waste your time ordering something which doesn't exist in their stock. Due to this I am not surprised that their shoe technology might also stopped at 80's... have lost confidence on the brand. plus the 30% off promotion is over, I have to give up on Nike now",02 June 2020,GB
Lauren,"Would have given ZERO stars if this was an option.Placed an order which they cancelled for no good reason and didn't even let me know so I had been waiting for the birthday present to be delivered, only to find out a week later that they had cancelled. Was told they'd honor the discount if I Re ordered (after being in the chat queue for 3hours) but it just so happens they are sold out of the trainer in the original size I had ordered so I wasn't able to get them anyway. I also ordered in the 30% off sale and believe this to be the true reason they had cancelled the order. Never buying from their site again.",02 June 2020,GB

Received no dispatch email so contacted them via the live chat about 2 weeks ago where I was told the items were waiting for dispatch. It's now 30/05 and still no updates. I could only get into contact with the company today via the live chat as the customer service number was unavailable, only for them to tell me that they can only offer me a refund and that the issue is ""already being handled by a higher department"". It seems they never had the items in stock as they aren't even on the website anymore. They have had my money for a month and a half and only after I've followed this up have they offered me a refund. I'm sure if I said nothing they would've just kept the money too.

Nolan,"Nike Air Max 360 worst shoe ever for the longest time sense the late 90’s. This is all I would wear is Air Max. Now they are the worse shoe ever have 3 pair currently and all 3 pairs have lost air in them, either the front toe side cushion or the heal cushion. Nike has such poor product right now. Have sent two pairs back to get two new pairs and same thing. Total waste of time and money. Buy On Cloud if you need a running shoe!! Will not buy Nikes for anyone in this household of 7. This is all the kids and wife used to wear including all sport cleats soccer, football and softball. Always something coming apart or falling apart with in the month. Everyone in this family is very particular about there shoes so they are well taken care of, as we will all flip out if someone is stepping or stepped on our shoes, making sure that all our shoes look new for the longest time. So it’s definitely not from being used or worn out. Kids now wear On Cloud along with the rest of the family and for the sports they are all wearing Addidas or Muzuno. Very disappointed in Nike you can totally see their product go down hill after the Air Max in 97,  Nike Mercurial Tempe 2 2015, and Nike Sharks up to 99. 20 years of product that just keeps getting worse.This also includes the clothing can not tell you how many times kids are taking something back to the store cause the stitching is not right or not straight, or wrong size when it says it’s supposed to be a certain size. Check the On Cloud clothing as well the kids love them also.Once a longtime customer!!!",25 May 2020,US

J Chabs,"Bought some Nike Reacts, running hat and vests on the 10/05/2020, receive email notification about delivery 3 days later. Delivery to be made on the 20/05/2020. Fair enough, 2 days later payment is taken from my account for the vests then next day for the hat then next day for the shoes. I made 1 order, was surprised to see different amounts the I didn’t recognise leaving my account. Soon realised that Nike was taking the money for what had been dispatched. Waiting for my parcel today, apparently it was delivered a couple of days ago by DPD. They put the parcel down by the security gate when they buzzed to come in. Took a picture and left. I didn’t know it was my parcel and normally the delivery’s drivers / post men all come up stairs to take a picture of delivered parcels. The parcels have gone missing and the Nike website still says due for delivery today. There’s is no email for Nike missed parcels, you can only call up and they don’t have 24 hour customer service so you have to call up between 9-5 when most are working. Really disappointed with Nike as they are normally really good with customer care but I feel like it has dropped the ball partly due to Covid-19 but that doesn’t mean it’s okay. Hopefully I can get a refund because I don’t feel comfortbale spending money with Nike again!UPDATE - currently on the phone to Nike... well, waiting to be connected for the last 35 mins.UPDATE - We are now in June and Nike has had no contact with me. This is the worst customer service I’ve received. Since lockdown they’ve dropped the ball massively. No refund, no contact, no email follow up. I just want my money back now. F***** ridiculous",20 May 2020,GB
Jelena Stasiuliene,"Very disappointed, quite a very long delivery, order placed 30/04/2020 , ordered 4 products,2 pairs of leggings and 2 sport bras, recieved 2 pairs of leggings in 1st parcel begging of May, and on the 11th of May in different parcel only one of my sport's bra's. Money were also taking from my account in bits and peaces which made me very confused as at least 1 month passed since i placed the original order,had to call bank to enquire who's trying to take strange amount from my account as could not recognise the amount and didn't show it was nike while pending. Did not receive even 1 email about missing sports bra, would be nice to know that i am not even getting it, it was a match for one of my leggings,so if i knew it wasn't in stock i would consider different outfit. And finally desert!!!! This made me write all this above.. my NIKE leggings called one Luxe Woman's mid rise leggings in Valerian Blue plus sports bra ARE NOT Dri-Fit technology 🤷🏼‍♀️ as YOU CLAIM ,thank God i only exercised home due to lockdown,i would be so ashamed in gym, looking like i  *eed myself 😭 ...really sorry nike, what's wrong with everything you do lately?! Can not call you TRUSTED BRAD anymore,very disappointed and disgusted with quality,do not understand how my outfit costs 100 e even on sale for this quality 🤷🏼‍♀️ ,i can survive all the delivery delays and have lots of patience for a good quality product but not for something i got,very disappointed in general,will defo be looking into different brands,also didn't realise you have so many bad reviews, like 2 star rating for Nike, should really be ringing a bell for you,i wish i could attach pictures of my outfit in here also,but will gladly share if you will ask, it's unacceptable. Regards,Jelena",20 May 2020,IE
lennycarl,"*DO NOT ORDER FROM NIKE.COM* I don't know how I can make myself any clearer. I made an order 11 days ago upwards of $500. After 5 days without a notification of shipment, I emailed them asking to cancel the order. After waiting 20 minutes for a customer service representative on live chat, they disconnected the chat. After waiting another 20 minutes, I was told that they had no control over the order once it was sent to the warehouse. They said they could request a hold on the order, which means it might get shipped (and I'll have to wait another 2-3 weeks for delivery only to send the products back, wait another 2-3 weeks for redelivery, then another 5-10 days for a refund = 2.5 months from original order date) OR it might not ship and I get a refund BUT I won't know for another 10-12 days. I am utterly disappointed, and will never EVER shop at Nike again.",20 May 2020,AU

Priscilla,I purchased a pair of running shoes from Nike Canada they were damaged when I wore them tryed to send them back and they refused to take them . Contacted the ceo of Nike Canada and he didn’t even have the courtesy to email me back . They then shipped them back at my expense both times and lost my shoes they refused to answer me when I endured and refused to look for my shoes when they were lost . So I render up with no shoes and I’m out 189 dollars . Bad consumer services I’ll never buy another thing from Nike Canada,19 May 2020,CA
Kristina Delaš,Avoid! I ordered my order 2 weeks ago and it still hasnt shipped. The option to email then on the website is not working and i was waiting on live chat several times for 45 minutes but it isnt helpful at all. Worst customer service.,19 May 2020,HR
Hanna Fomchanka,"I have a very upsetting experience with Nike.com purchase. Unfortunately, I have decided to place an order with official Nike website for running shoes on May 8th, 2020. My old running shoes got broken and I needed to replace them urgently in order to keep running and stay healthy while in lockdown. I did not realise that orders with Nike.com take at least 3 weeks to be delivered. Once I saw my delivery date, I have decided to cancel the order and purchase the shoes somewhere else. When I called Nike support in the UK, they have told me that they will place a request to warehouse to not dispatch my order and within 3 days I will receive an e-mail either confirming or refusing the request. If I receive refusal, I have to call back. For the starters, I did not receive any e-mail. In a week time, I called back. Please note every call takes at least 1 hour wait to reach any representative of the support team. Once I reached Nike UK support team again, they said that there was a refusal from warehouse, however I did not receive any e-mail. So, I was requested to wait until my order is dispatched and then call again to try to cancel it. I did exactly as support team advised. I have received today an e-mail that my order was dispatched and I called support team for the 3rd time to cancel the delivery. Today, the support representative told me that there is only 50% chance that the cancellation will be successful and that more likely I will receive the shoes and will have to mail them back in order to receive my refund. This is so poorly manged in my opinion, especially taking into consideration that  I have received my new Adidas running shoes within 3 days and have been using them all this time wile Nike is struggling to simply cancel my order for all these days and on top of everything Nike put me in the position that I have to go to mail their product back in the conditions of lockdown.",19 May 2020,GB

As expected shipment delays relating to COVID, but came at the dates (about 3 weeks later) expected and was updated frequently on any shipment updates. I also had to exchange one pair and customer service was patient. I had to be on hold as they placed the exchange order and the representative would come back every few minutes to update me that the system was taking a little long in placing the order. Also, I was disconnected twice during the call but was able to resume the order as the representatives were able to communicate with each other find where the order was left off. They were also very informative on the exchanging process and answered all of my questions.",18 May 2020,US

After attempting to speak with someone on live chat, which was about 45 mins wait, the person said they will elevate this to their ""Elite services team"". This was after I tried placing the order with 3 credit cards, Paypal and Apple Pay using the Nike App. Told me that I had to wait 3-5 days for an email reply and only they can contact me. Called customer service number couple days later, waited for another 1.5 hrs on the phone. The man who helped me couldn't care less. His voice sounded like he just woke up. Again told me they have elevated the situation and they don't know what to do. Just now, I got a 3 sentence email saying ""You will need to obtain your Nike gear at other authorized retailers"" due to ""previous unauthorized charges"". What does that even mean? I have purchased many times from Nike and my credit cards are working just fine as of today. They could at least have the decency to explain why I can't place an order. I guess they don't want the business. Thank you, next.",18 May 2020,JP

I have to keep calling my bank weekly to request a refund of my money, and this is not even the annoying thing, because nike keeping charging me every single week for something that I didn't, if a bank is contact the company and say: Listen it's a fraud, they should stop to charge people, it's so bad this. Nike should be more effective on this issue of fraud.  If IIt continues in this way, I will contact my lawyer for more efficient measures.  I never bought online on the Nike website, and after that bad experience, I will never buy.

Total waste of my time. Furthermore I went to check on the Nike website and I saw the shoes that they said were “out of stock” were still available.

So, here's the story. My Nike Adapt BB is not working, and I have been trying everything I could to make it work. It didn't. Therefore, I contacted Nike Customer Service. I waited 45 minutes and finally, someone answered my message, he provided no solution, and he asked me to call the Nike Customer service. I did, after waiting for 1.5 hours, someone finally responded. He hasn't only repeated what the first staff had told me; he even teased that my shoes might not be an authentic one. After this experience, I would rather have Adidas than having a company that requires their customer to wait more than 2 hours yet could not solve their problem but calling their shoes fake.

Martin Dunk,Awful experience from the point that I made my order. I placed an order for a pair of trail running shoes nearly 2 months ago paying for express delivery (5days). This date came an passed so I contacted Nike who explained due to COVID delivery times had extended. I fully understood this and was refunded my express delivery fee. 2 weeks later I have still not heard anything from Nike for my delivery details so I sit in the queue to talk with an online advisor and I’m told the shoes have not left the warehouse and there is no expected delivery date due to COVID. I’m starting to feel they are using this as an excuse and request the order is cancelled and I’m told a refund will be with me in 3-5 days. No refund received after 10 days so I contact them again only to be told the refund was failed to be processed and “Art” the supervisor emailed me to advise this. I have received nothing in my spam or regular emails on this. A further 7-10 days until I will receive my refund! We’ll see if this one actually comes through. Needless to say but Nike have lost a customer who used to buy and advise others to use their products. The customer service has been absolutely pathetic!,14 May 2020,GB

Mary Margaret,"My sister, who has three teenage sons who all play competitive sports and are loyal Nike consumers, reached out to Nike to inquire about the ability to special order cleats for her son who has Cerebral Palsy and plays soccer. Due to his disability, he is in the need of two different sized shoes, a 12 and 9.5, which has led to my sister, who is a single mother, having to buy two pairs of shoes regularly to accommodate the shoe size difference and his rapid growth as a 16-year-old who is now over 6' tall. Nike has denied the willingness to accommodate this special order to provide the support my nephew's disability is needing for him to continue engaging in sports, which has been a huge confidence booster for him. As loyal Nike consumers, my family is all disappointed in Nike's lack of responsiveness to this - especially given the large platform and advertisement Nike gives to support athletes of all backgrounds.

Alongside that, the Nike box was placed into a slightly bigger box with no bubble wrap or other form of filler to keep it from being damaged or tossed around.

So if I never asked I'd just be out the money? Wow... Terrible system. Can I charge interest for loaning them money for 45 days?",04 May 2020,US
Samuel Maduka,"At first it was a little bit of a bumpy ride but it got better. To be honest, I’m very impressed with the way Nike handled my situation. The first problem with my order was the dispatch. My dispatch email came like a week after I ordered my shoes. On top of that, I had sent 2 emails to customer service about that dispatch email. I had this really nice and caring person who replied to me within a day and my order was taken care of. My suggestion would be if you’re ordering from Nike during this Covid -19 period, prepare to wait at least 2-3 weeks for your order but nonetheless thanks Nike for my good quality shoes!",04 May 2020,IE

Georgia,Took ages to ship - seems everything is shipped from the EU which is not made clear on their site (I am in the UK). It’ll be about 3 weeks before I get my shoes which I need urgently (current ones have holes that are getting bigger daily). To make matters worse they’ve charged me twice - once at time of ordering and again at dispatch - thus sending me into unplanned overdraft which I will be penalised for. I’m told the original amount will be released to my account in 24 days (it was reserved not withdrawn); surely this reserved amount should have been drawn down upon rather than being charged again?! I’m sure many people wouldn’t have the cash flow to finance two lots of payments for the 24 days (and why are they holding for 24days it should only be 7),04 May 2020,GB
Ian Hegedus,"Make sure you read ALL of the fine print before buying from Nike. They ""say"" free returns but that only applies to members. I bought 2 pairs of shoes for my wife. Spent hundreds of dollars. Neither pair fit correctly. Now I have to pay more money to return them because I'm not a member. For a multi billion dollar company they should be offering free returns to everyone. Not just ""members""",04 May 2020,US

Essa,"I’m looking at all the reviews and I can see a lot of people complaining or saying nike didn’t deliver their products.However, I ordered my package on the 24th  of April and received it on the 29th of April (despite the app saying arriving 11th of May). Their service is very good and I ordered a hoody and tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt and they all arrived packaged nicely. All the people complaining about their packages I am slightly worried that some people are not taking this situation to mind and understanding that there is a global pandemic right now. I hope people can acknowledge that maybe your package takes a bit longer than it does, just have some patience. Your not going to die without it and what are you going to do with your new running shoes or fitness clothing? Nothing. Because it’s lockdown. Please be more considerate.I ordered something from Armani and it took so long that I thought it wasn’t going to arrive and I had lost the money. But it ended up arriving. So please understand there is no reason to stress out.Patience is a blessing and test in itself. I hope you all stay well during everything going on and that your families and you are safe.

Kelly Macinnis-MacLean,"I had to put at least one star in order to review, but the worst online customer support I’ve ever witnessed. Agents seem to not want to help at all. Ordered shoes on the 18th of April & had an online chat employee inform me I will get them eventually, after speaking to someone previously who instead of answering any questions informed me to call a number where I waited an hour on hold to be told it’s the wrong number & then transferred to a number where all the lines were down lol. First and last time I will be ordering from their website. I know everything is so busy with online shopping and shipping issues but I’ve had zero issues with any other company. Yes it took longer Then usual which is expected but to say eventually and not even bother to try to help makes me think Nike doesn’t need my business. The experience made me feel like I was more of a bother then anything.",29 April 2020,CA

Stacey,Ordered from nike twice now while this covid-19 is still happening & they have done a brilliant job in delivering my items!

Aidan Tanti,"Bought a pair of running shoes from London Nike store last December, Nike zoom Pegasus turbo 2 and it costed me 187 euros, now on both shoes I have got a tear just under the Nike badge. I was on holiday when I bought it and now I am in Malta. Have been using it for races and only done a total of 185km. After talking to them on chat, their only solution was to catch a flight and get back to London Nike store. Definitely disappointed with their service and product especially when it costs 187 Euros. Also asked if I can send it back by shipping and they said that it is not possible.",28 April 2020,MT

Jamie,"Never will I shop Nike's again. Extremely disappointed. Not only was I informed it would take 5-7 business days to get the shoes prior to paying for them, but its been 14 days now and i still have yet to receive them... But also I was just recently informed that one of the pairs was cancelled due to insufficient inventory, which should be something Nike already needs to be aware of before a purchase is made. Very unprofessional due to any excuse, even if it is Covid-19, because atleast then you could give a heads up it may take longer then usual etc., I will definitely let my shoe loving friends know not to order from you guys, to make sure they dont get the experience I did.   Sincerely, Jamie Cauley",27 April 2020,US
Cath 123,"TERRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE!I have contacted Nike multiple times because of an issue regarding a reserved amount on my account. First I contacted them pr. email where it seemed like they wouldn’t answer my question, they just answered me with a bunch of facts about my order that i already knew and that didn’t have anything to do with my question. Then i decided to call them, because maybe it was me who wasn’t able to put what i meant in writing. First i talked to a woman who was nice enough but she didn’t really answer my question still. So i decided to call them again, i then talked to THE RUDEST costumer service employee I have ever come across in my life. He YELLED at me, he wouldn’t believe what i was saying, and then when i tried to explain he HUNG UP!! This kind of terrible service is UNACCTEPABLE, especially when it is a huge company like NIKE!!",27 April 2020,DK
Paul R,"4 weeks and still waiting for my exchange of trainers. Have queued and live chatted with three different agents- all assured me that they would authorise the exchange with proof of posting the original trainers which I supplied. Nothing happened. After speaking to a fourth agent on chat, was told that the exchange was now authorised. A week later the progress with my order still hasn’t updated. Waited an hour to actually speak to an agent- completely rude and indifferent agent ‘Caitlin’. Computer says- we’re still processing your order. What’s there to process Nike? It’s a pair of trainers! Take them off your Warehouse shelf and put them in the post! Caitlin completely unwilling to offer any assurance as to when my order would be dispatched. Useless. Avoid buying direct from them and use a third party seller if you want a decent service.",25 April 2020,GB

Ya Pal James,Buggy website and unhelpful customer service. I made sure my account was verified a week before the shoes I wanted released. My account was not receiving the verification text but by using my brother's mobile number I was able to verify my account after customer service apologized to me and simply said that I would not be able to buy shoes without a verified account. On the release of the shoe I connected my laptop to the ethernet cable to make sure my internet was running quickly. Every time I clicked buy on the shoe the website would either crash or say an error had occurred. Eventually the shoes sold out and I was unable to buy them. I won't be purchasing online with Nike again.,25 April 2020,NZ

Asher Ward,If I could give them a negative 5 stars It would be justified.  Virtually no customer service to escalate and resolve issue.  Horrible  chat reps.

Kiara Winston,Amazing shoes and the fast shipping for being a member is great. I thought I was on the wrong review. Because I order 5 shoes from Nike so far and all my shoes were in perfect Condition and outstanding. And the shoes look like they were never worn. I love Nike and I will continue to order my shoes from them. Customer service also good and if you have a question about a shoe in the app you can message a representative and they will gladly help you so I recommend this site.,19 April 2020,US
Sajida Ahmed,Very very disappointed. I bought the nike one luxe for 59.95 the first order was fantastic quality of the leggings were great so I bought a blue pair. I ordered another black pair in april and it arrived nothing like what I have seen. The material looked faded and so did the quality. What has happened. Tried to  contact nike however no response and its absolutely shocking how they can charge that price and not deliver consistent quality.,19 April 2020,GB

Customer,"As many people have stated, Nike are taking orders that they can't deliver on. They are then refusing to cancel or refund the order and are just holding customers money. Cowboys. They are also refusing to offer the customer a right of withdrawal that the customer should legally have.

The amount shouldn’t matter - every customer should be treated equally - but trying to spend over £1k online and have been getting the same error message relating to billing information for over a week now. Have spoken to Nike staff several times and they have no solution to the problem. Said if I waited 24hrs I would be able to place the order; I waited 48hrs and STILL cannot place a significantly downsized order for barely £300. On three occasions now, after waiting more than ten minutes on hold, iv spoken to staff only to be cut off as soon as the conversation gets difficult for them and they run out of ideas to solve the solution... Impatient, incompetent and actually quite upsetting. I shall be ordering from Under Armour from now on.",15 April 2020,GB

P shrivastava,Horrible Company. I recently ordered some lebron for my kid. I waited seven day even though it came from Indiana.(only a four hour drive from where I live)It came my son opened it and wore it for three seconds and took it off. Then he looked in it and saw that the logo on the sole was off. He didn’t even run. He just sat down and that was enough for the shoe to wear out. Horrible quality. Never order from Nike.,10 April 2020,US
Paulina Powroznik,"I just had the worst customer experience in my lifetime. Some time ago I ordered from Nike 2 pairs of shoes, I sent back one of them. After a while I got an email that I should provide them with my bank details for a refund. Strange that a company this size cannot simply send back the money to the account from which the payment was made. Anyway. I never received the refund. Tried to reach them and by phone or chat it takes ages. Finally reached them via a chat and was told I made a mistake with my bank details but they can't help me there and also can't tell me what was wrong or send me a link to give in bank details again. I was told I have to call them. After 20 minutes waiting on the line I started talking to a guy who finally seemed to be able to correct the bank details but then it seemed he didn't hear me anymore, even though I could hear him perfectly, so that conversation ended. Then I called again but after 15 minutes waiting on the line someone just hung up on me before I had a chance to utter a word. Then called again and, after another 15 or 20 minutes, talked to a woman who said she can't help me because she can't deal with any bank details herself. She will contact her manager and her manager will contact her and then she will give me a call and maybe will be able to send me an email with the link where I can leave my bank details!!!!! This is ridiculous!!!I've never had such a terrible experience, will never again order anything from Nike, from now on only Under Armour or Adidas!!!Paulina",09 April 2020,NL

I tell the woman on the phone that I would like it redirected. She confirms. She then proceeeds to notify me my item has been cancelled and I can expect a refund within 5 days. So rather than being redirected, my item has now been cancelled by her mistake and she tells me she is unable to undo it.

I have received emails regarding the payment, the payment invoice, a tracking link for my order, when the order has been dispatched and so on. The delivery is expected tomorrow and I’m surprised with this because of the lockdown and what is happening now everywhere in the world. I’m very happy that Nike still processed orders and that they’re making their best in delivering on time.

Telont,Ordered Nike Free RN 5.0 Men's Running Shoe from a mail shot by Nike. Received email accepting order with delivery date by 30/3/20. A few days later Nike contacted to me and apologised that product delayed and could not guarantee by 30/3. Although disappointed it was not a big issue with the Self Isolation rules in place so I sat back and waited. On 28/3 I received another email telling me that the product was being shipped and that DPD would be delivering. Happy with that as they are my favourite delivery agent (other than PO). As I have the DPD App I checked today 29th with DPD and was informed parcel on the way to their depot and I would receive on 30th. Alls well that ends well and completely satisfied. Looking forward to my new runners to admire in anticipation of putting to use.,29 March 2020,GB

Lynette Leanox,"I have to say that I went to buy a pair of shoes.   I saw a pair of Nike Flyknit shoes, priced close to $200 dollars.  I buy these shoes, not caring about the price because if I want something nice I realize I will have to pay.   I’ve always been told that you pay for what you get.  Mind you I bought these shoes about four months ago.  I take very good care of my things.  I am walking at work and all of a sudden two of the bubbles on my left shoe burst.  I then call the Nike corporate office and they gave me a claim number, in which we pay for shipping.  I then immediately ship these shoes to them all for them to say that they will not warranty these shoes because of a “rubbing or friction” which caused the things to pop.  I am very angry about this because we as consumers buy something, we should expect it to last.  Especially the cost of these shoes.  I have shoes that I have had for years that still look brand new and wear them almost daily and have had no problems. Nike Flyknit shoes are a joke and so is Nike.  I will never buy a pair of Nike shoes ever again.  I know it will not matter because so many people across the country buy from Nike and me not buying them will just be a drop in the bucket to them.  Everyone beware of these shoes as they are junk and definitely not worth the money I paid for them.  I will use them as dog chew toys when I receive them back.

Shannon Johnechecck,"We purchased my son the Flyknit shoes , he has had them for 1 month and the soles are wearing out already no way they will last a whole season. We purchased his basketball shoes, football/baseball  cleats everyday shoes from Nike and have not had a problem that’s why spending 100-200 dollars a pair doesn’t usually bother me but I am very disappointed In these shoes . Getting ahold of someone from Nike also is not easy. I did get a shipment label to send that back but was told they will look at them and determine if they should replace them or not so now he goes without for who knows how long. Again not happy!",21 March 2020,US

Jay,"I called customer service which directed me to Dublin to complain about a product I purchased from the Nike Factory on the 11th March 2020 in London. It was labelled incorrectly, I live 1.5 hours away as I total will cost me 3 hours of my time to get there and back. and all I wanted was a refund. I spoke to Ryan and Daniel who both were unhelpful. I asked Daniel to log a compliant and he said there’s no point as head office will not deal with it. I got to go back to the store!!! I asked him to ask the store to get in touch but he said no! It’s down to me to call them. The store has not been answering the phone so there has been no hope. I can’t believe a massive retailer like Nike has such poor customer service coming for the service line! And stated the head office wouldn’t deal with this either so no point logging the complaint. I just wanted to post the item back or perhaps go to another Nike store just not the factory as it’s out of my way.",12 March 2020,GB

Purchased a new pair of Nike by you weeks ago and arrived in worse condition. Black stains that won’t remove from the upper, used and painted badly soles that are cracking and with chips already taken out. Contacted Nike only for them to say send them back. They did not care about me or the facts I’ve spent thousands over the years with their company. Also used a gift card for partial payment and asked for them to refund me in cash since I won’t be shopping with them again, they said no. Seriously done with this pirate company who still uses child labour in their sweatshops. Wasters",04 March 2020,US

Anne,"So I will keep it facts. Bought a present/surprise for my partner on 1st Feb 2020. It should be delivered on 3rd or 4th by DPD. I got a text message saying that it should delivered between 2-3 PM. I knew I'm not going in so chose it to be left at safe place. When came back home I checked safe place and it was not there, no card was left as well. Lucky I had CCTV's so I checked and fact was confirmed that driver was not even there. Then I checked the tracking number - and surprise! It says it was delivered and signed by me. So I called Nike - of course they didn't pick up the phone (as this was a gift I was not really happy to miss the birthday). I then called DPD and women answered. She checked and confirmed the fact that driver went to the wrong street and delivered to the wrong address (checked by GPS in DPD's car). She advised me to order new one so I could get this before birthday which was after a couple of days. She said I will be refunded and the item if found will be delivered back to Nike. I ordered new one at it was delivered after couple of days. Now the interesting part is that I still haven't received my item or refund. There was a DPD guy after a couple of days and asked me to sign for the item which I not received, he said the person for who driver delivered was at my address and left parcel ""somewhere near the door"", I checked cctv, yes there was a person (not sure if that's the one as, was away at the time), but cannot see if he left anything and more over I haven't found anything. It was one of the days when we had a windy days here in UK so not sure if he left or the wind took away but if it would be given to my hands I would sign for it (as it should be done in first instance) there wouldn't be any problems. So keeping in mind DPD did their mistake, but I bought from Nike - not from DPD and they are the one who should be responsible. I opened even paypal dispute, customer service a rude and saying every time different - they will check within 8 days, they will check within 9 days after I write every week to Nike. Now it's 4 weeks after and I haven't got nor my money nor my item. They even haven't apologised. I hate this company, won't buy anymore (keeping in mind their quality is going down). So that there wouldn't be stupid questions acting as they do care about me I will provide order reference number here, and do not contact me - I don't want to hear this brand name anymore!

Abby Cooper,"I ordered a pair of custom shoes on January 8th 2020, and they still haven't come!!!  (today is February 26th 2020) my shoes were originally supposed to arrive on February 4th, then the date got changed to the 11th, and now they say that my shoes are supposed to come by march 2nd but I wouldn't be surprised if I have to wait another month. overall very disappointed. on their website it said custom shoes will be shipped and delivered between 3-5 weeks and that obviously was false information. I have been waiting for 7 weeks now and am getting frustrated at this point. I had even called the nike site to see what was happening with my order and the person on the end of the line wasn't very helpful. I thought I was going to get these court shoes on time for a tournament, as I am a high performance athlete and am in need of a new pair of shoes, and was extremely upset that they didn't come when they said they were supposed to. i am not one to complain easily but I could have not been more disappointed in a brand that I like so much. I don't think I'm going to be ordering anything off of the nike website again. especially not after the amount of time I am still waiting for my shoes.",27 February 2020,CA

I have to say, the online chat is always quick, easy and the agents are always so friendly and knowledgeable. Errors and mistakes happen, but it’s how a company and people deal with them. In my experience with Nike and their customer services team they have always been professional and gone that extra mile. Praise where it is due. A+",26 February 2020,GB
Sarah Redmond Morris,"This is the second time I'm writing this review as it deleted my last one! :(At the end of January I ordered a pair of customized running shoes.  They were supposed to be delivered Feb 20.  Feb 2 the cost of the shoes was deducted from my checking account.  Feb 19 I received an email stating that they were starting to make my shoes.  Feb 21 I received an email stating that they would be delivered in 1-4 days.  Feb 25 I called Nike customer service because I hadn't heard from Nike yet.  I was told that they would be delivered in April!  The customer service agent told me it would be best to take a refund.  He said it would be refunded in 1-2 days.  I asked him if I would receive an email with this information, but he hung up on me.  I did receive an email stating that my order was cancelled, but nothing was mentioned about my refund.  I guess if I don't get it in 2 days I'll have to call back.SO DISAPPOINTING  NIKE MUST do better!!",25 February 2020,US

Matt Brodie,I ordered my daughter some shin pads over 2 weeks ago. I received the item in good time but they were too big. I called Nike & explained I’ll be returning them & need a SMALL. They sent a LARGE so I sent them back a week ago & not had any communication or delivery of her shin pads. She has had 2 games where she has had to borrow shin pads as a result & tomorrow this will be her 3rd game. Very frustrating and not what I expect from super brand like Nike. They offered me 15% as goodwill which is £2.50!! I have used £2.50 PLUS in fuel going back & forth to Royal Mail to return goods & on phone to them! P*** take,22 February 2020,GB

Paris Lee Ann,I pre-ordered an item on Nike's website on 01/23. I received an email stating that this would be delivered by 02/03. A few days before the delivery date I received another email stating that my order would be arriving late on 02/05. For the inconvenience they provided me with a 20% off coupon. Awesome right? Not quite. On the new arrival date 02/05 I received another email stating that it will now be another 1-4 business days before it's arrival. On the 3rd business day we got ANOTHER email showing that I would no longer be receiving my order because it is not in stock. If you don't have enough of the item then it should not be listed as available! I also PRE-ORDERED this item WEEKS in advance because it would only be sold for a limited time. When I tried to get this resolved I was told that they would escalate my feedback and contact me in 2 to 3 business days to see what they can do for me. Over a week later I still hadn't heard from them. I called again and was told they would not compensate anything due to them sending a 20% off coupon already. This coupon was specifically for the order being LATE not for anything else. Not only was the order late but I also didn't receive it and they cancelled the order. Nike kept saying my order was coming instead of letting me know that it was out of stock. Now I will not get the chance to purchase this item since it is no longer sold! This was a horrible experience and I am super bummed that I won't get the chance to have this item.,19 February 2020,US

Marcia Lee Ann Magennis,"Absolutely the most disgusting customer service or lack of it ever.  I would have expected more from such a big company.  My 15 year old son spent his hard earned money buying a pair of nike sport shoes online on 22nd January 2020, from South Australia,  We are in New South Wales and here it is 17th February and still no shoes,  confusing tracking that does not accurately show where the so called shoes are,  My son needed these for sport at school and is currently wearing his old Nike sports shoes which fell apart after only 3 months, he keeps glueing them back together to try and last until his delivery comes.  Very poor response from nike from both emails and phone calls regarding this.  I am absolutely disgusted and will be telling everyone far and wide to NOT buy from this company.  My son and I certainly will never deal with Nike again.  what sort of company rips of a 15 year old kid.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.",17 February 2020,AU

The red coloring on the toe has been completely removed as well as on the black Nike sign on the side of the shoe. I spoke with customer service and they informed me that they needed me to ship his new shoes back to be inspected by claims. So now we are expected to ship his shoes for who knows how long to be inspected. My family will not be purchasing Nike brand shoes, apparel, or any accessory manufactured by this company in the near future of ever at all. For $60 I could of bought basic shoes and painted the Nike logo on it and guaranteed my craft paint would not of removed after 2 days.

Unfortunately he lost the receipt and we were not able to go back to the store cause they will not care unless you have proof of purchase. I reached out to the customer service and they replied that they do not review your complaint unless you have a receipt because they are protecting their authenticity and integrity. Sad they treat their customers like that. I believe their integrity should be shown in the quality of the products, but instead a pair of $220 shoes are worst quality than a pair of $10 K-mart shoes.",11 February 2020,AU

Kryzzel,"Awful customer service due to lack of communication and sharing of information. I ordered a pair of shoes for a Christmas present and it arrived. However, needed an exchange as it was quite narrow so needed a wide fitting shoes instead. Called Nike and said okay an exchange is possible. Sent the original shoes and after a week, no shoes arrived yet so called again and they said to wait a bit longer. We called five times in the space of a month already. Yup, 5 weeks and still no shoes. Offered a refund instead. You would think that Nike is a big brand however communication and organisation needs to be improved greatly. some of the staff were apologetic though. In summary, customer experience must be accounted for or else you will lose customers.",07 February 2020,GB

R Roberts,"pretty awful - I ordered some shoes via telephone from their Irish call centre - presnet for my wife's birthday. After a week or so, no shoes arrived - I checked the Order Status, and it turned out they had cancelled the order. I called the call centre - was told that when they cancel orders, they don't inform the customer (apparently cancellation was because the bank details didn't quite match those with HSBC). Great - so no i have no present for my wife. Worse than that - there is a debit on my HSBC account for £239.95. They won't release it without something in writing from Nike (to confirm they won't be sending any shoes).  So another call is necessary to Nike in Ireland - the lady in the call centre says she is 'not authorised' to send me anything in writing confirming they will not fulfil the order.  Another long wait listening to elevator music, now ongoing....   really awful processes/customer service. Why not inform customers when orderes are cancelled? Why not put things in writing?

Lexi Clavet,"With some recycled materials being present in three-quarters of its products, Nike is an industry trailblazer for sustainability. The Nike Air range of trainers uses at least 50% recycled materials and diverts more than 95% of waste from landfills, plus the company is soon to release a range of trainers dyed with plant-based dyes, which reduces pollution of waterways.

Becky Collins,My son bought Nike football boots worth £90.  We knew they would take longer because he'd added his own logo to them and we were told they would be 4 weeks.  They never arrived so we called Nike (not easy) to find out where they were.  We were told they had tried to deliver them but couldn't find the address so instead of ringing the number on the order they returned them to the depot.  I was told they would get resent but nothing arrived so I had to make yet another call.  I was then old they had gone to Belgium!!  They were going to have them sent to us.  A week went by and still nothing not even a phone call or an apology up until now. My son was still wearing boots that were pinching his feet while we waited.  When I rung again I was told that they were refunding the money and not sending them to us.  Had I not rung then we would still be waiting.  I checked my account whilst on the phone to them and they hadn't refunded the money.  They said it would take a few days.  It didn't take that long when I paid for them!  We gave up and bought an addidas pair.  I will never shop Nike again online.,17 January 2020,GB

Lucy,"I like Nike trainers but they are a bit too expensive. They should lower their prices. The Flyknit material gets torn up too easily, especially where my big toe is. I bought a pair of Flyknit Max trainers and on both left and right side a hole developed where my big toes are. The problem is with the flyknit mesh, it's too weak. It's a shame because they were really comfy to wear.",13 January 2020,TR
Samantha Mackinnon,Customer service need to be worked on you want people to buy trainers for £150 but when they have a fault no one want to help to get issues sorted at the shop on line chat or email. My son Air Max 270 the hook that holds the lace in has fraid and hosnknly wore them a few time out and just walking around as he only goes out with us. How a company so big can have the worst customer service is be on me. I will never shop in Nike again for anything for my family never had an issue before it. And the one time we do they dont care they just want £150 for crap trainers that dont last not even a month. Think before you shop with Nike there product are not worth the money they are asking for.

Emailed and got a useless generic response with nothing but waffle and no information about the delay. Called the next day and was told the delay was due to a “problem at the warehouse” which I took to mean they don’t have the shoes in stock although they denied this,the shoes are still available to purchase online in my size.

What's a joke gift cards are created to be a gift for someone and how can I now send them that proof?? So at this point I'm left WITHOUT my money and WITHOUT the shoes.

Mr Daniel c,I have always bought Nike trainers in particular air max and collect them. Where Do i start late November 19 purchased a pair of Nike air max bowfins upon delivery they were faulty hole in the top upper mesh poor stitching so I returned purchased from footlocker. Early December (Christmas present)Nike air max 90 camowabb just released so I bought a pair from size.Co.Uk upon delivery poor stitching once again leather not sewn to the underneath fabric resulting in raw material exposed to the elements. So I once again retuned. One week later purchased Nike air max tailwind purchased from Nike.Com upon delivery whole in the leather were it joins the sole multiple stitching errors so I returned once again. This happened to me last year aswell at the same time of the year two different pairs of trainers both returned because of quality issues. Gets me thinking is nike selling factory seconds or even thirds at Christmas time because they no there is a less chance of people returning them as they are Christmas presents and family's wouldn't want there loved ones to go without at Christmas just my opinion but surely not a coincidence in my case. At £150-£200 a pair I expect a excellent quality trainer. P. S people always check the quality of your trainers when bought from Nike or any other retailer as I am buy no means paying this amount of money for a poor quality shoe. NIKE WHERE IS QUALITY CONTROL???,29 December 2019,GB

Cassandra Dickens,"This is a horrible company!!! They sponsored and supported Micheal Vick even after he tortured poor helpless dogs !!! ""For all of you that say Vick should be forgiven - give this a read.Most people are aware that Michael Vick was a dogfighter. They may even have illusions of what they think dogfighting is at its worst or the suspected actions that take place. However, what Vick did was not simple dogfighting.I have struggled real hard with trying not to hold a past against someone because I believe in forgiving and that people can change. I have come to the conclusion that some things are simply unforgivable for me.Some of those things are what he chose to do.Picture your dog or your friends dog tossed to a couple of animals trained to fight for humans. Imagine that animal screaming as it is being ripped apart and having its throat ripped out. Imagine the person that tossed that helpless animal to the other animals just laughing as it occurs and later admitting he thought it was funny. That person who tossed the animals to the others is Michael Vick.Imagine taking a bucket used to hold water, filling it with water, and holding a dogs head in it until it drowns while it stands on land.Have you ever thought of the image of hanging a dog? He did that too. He also picked them up over his head before slamming them downward on concrete at his full force over and over.As a bodybuilder, I know the strength of professional athletes. Imagine the blunt force trauma that dog felt as it hit concrete over and over from not dying the first time.He also attached jumper cables to their ears and tossed them in a pool to electrocute them.This is not about dogfighting. That has become a separate issue. The acts in dogfighting are disgusting and reprehensible. What Vick did was to take it one step further and find a way to legitimately torture dogs like a horror movie.I know that he went to prison (he was sentenced to 23 months under RICO), but that was not for the animal torture.In Virgina, he was charged with two class-6 felonies, which each carried a maximum of 5 years in prison. He submitted a guilty plea to a single Virginia felony charge for dogfighting, receiving a 3-year prison sentence suspended on condition of good behavior, and a $2,500 fine. In return for the plea agreement, the other charge was dropped.Everyone else, but animal advocates, seem unaware of what he truly did and most are probably unaware of the time he actually served and for what basis.Upon exiting prison for RICO:He received a sponsorship from Nike and he went back to playing in the NFL.Now, he is an analyst on TV for football and he was just selected as a legends captain for the 2020 NFL Pro Bowl.All because the man could run fast with a football.And the general public does not seem to mind one bit about any of it.""",29 December 2019,US
Sam Whitehouse,"I generally wear an M size but decided to order the S size and it was a wise choice. This short is a fleece-like material inside, a little warm, and snug in the small size for wearing them playing tennis- the small size gives a little support, and the stretch in the material is enough so that having 2 tennis balls in my pocket doesn't cause any binding restriction of movement.They are also good for just lounging around in - the two front pockets are generous and I can easily carry my keys, and phone without fear of them falling out. The back pocket is equally sized and the snap ensures that when I have my wallet with me it will remain secure.I have washed them before wearing and the shrinkage is minimal- the blend of material doesn't dry very quickly but even hang drying the fabric stays soft.",28 December 2019,GB

Nick D.,"Ordered a pair of Bred 11s on the 14th and was told they'd be at my house on the 20th. The 20th came and went and no shoes. Never heard anything from Nike. I contacted customer service (if you can even call them that) and they said the order could not be fulfilled from the warehouse and that i would be receiving a refund. WHAT!? So after having to figure this out on my own, they told me that someone would contact me within 3-5 days to start the return. HUH!? Never heard from anyone. Contacted them again and they said they would escalate the claim to the ""Elite Team"" (i beg to differ). Never heard from anyone. Received an email saying my return was approved. Ummm...ok? Still have no idea what's going on. Still have't heard from anyone. Still don't have my money back and it's the 26th now. This is insane. I've spent THOUSANDS on Nike this year. Over $1000 just on Nike.com and many other pairs through local shops. This is the worst experience I've ever had and I will NEVER be buying Nikes again. I am selling the pairs in my collection and will only be buying Adidas, Yeezys,New Balance and Under Armor from here forward. Nike doesn't care about it's customers whatsoever, and it shows.

Fernanda Barros,"A joke, a completely distrustful company. You’d think they’d be all for satisfying the consumer since they are a huge corporation and that they would have a sophisticated website. Well it’s just the opposite. I waited weeks for the Nike Air Force 1 and really needed them in time for a vacation coming up (01/03/20). Well finally they became available yesterday and I got the notification, therefore placing my order as soon as I saw the shoe “in stock”. I decided to do a pick up at my nearest Nike store so I could get them as quick as possible, the pick up would be for today (the next day). Woke up to an email saying that the shoe was out of stock and that I couldn’t go pick them up anymore because my order was canceled. You’d think they would let you know if they had the shoe available or not before you place it in your cart. I find this super unprofessional for such a large corporation.I called customer service and Dani was very nice, and helpful. She wanted to help in any way, shape or form possible. We decided to order .5 a size up, which I settled for. (Keep in mind that their shipping takes 2-4 days)Well I placed the order with Dani in order for us to see the estimated shipping arrival date, and the shipping arrival date was, you guessed it longer than 4 days. It was 7 days, this would not be an appropriate date, due to my vacation which was much earlier than that. I ended up canceling my order this morning and I am very unhappy with the Nike company. I have been a loyal customer for various years and am dissatisfied with the service they provide, especially with the handling of their inventory control.",26 December 2019,US
greg,"JEEEEZE... so, I found out, after live chatting with Charles (great guy, super informative, helpful and transparent) that you can not use a gift card on the Nike.com website, UNLESS it is from Nike ONLY. Like ... what!??!? So the policy is, you can not use a 3rd party gift card, you have to purchase a gift card on a 3rd party site, wait for delivery (email or physical) and then use it. NOWHERE AT CHECK OUT, does Nike mention this. NOWHERE! This is a joke (the lack of information and the policy itself). I have placed many, many orders on the website, first time using a gift card. This has turned me off completely of their website (I have had a bad experience with their CX before this [sent me out a ""new"" pair of sneakers with stains on them and then wouldn't let me return them]) . While I love Nike products and will continue to purchase and wear, the policies, procedures and overall customer experience on their website needs a complete redoing.

When I got the dispatched email, I phoned them and they told me they can't reroute the package and I just have to return it when the package arrives.

As I won't be around from 22nd, for my boyfriend to get his Christmas pressie, I am going to have to bring him out and buy another pair as the size of the ones in transit are wrong. I hadn't budgeted for this. A very costly mistake on my part. Once I get my refund (God only knows when that will happen!) I will never shop for Nike online again. I will only buy from a retailer. Awful experience.",14 December 2019,IE
Gurjeet Kaur,"I love this brand, but their employees at stores are  not doing justice to this brand name. I went to buy Air Force one shoes for women. So, I asked someone to help me to find me if they have my size. Employee pointed to find it here and told me to ask her if help needed.when I didn’t find my size after looking , then I asked another employee as previous one was busy helping another old man. So second one told me to wait and never showed up. I kept on waiting for quite some time and then decided to leave the store.I hope they will work on their customer service as they work hard on their brand name.

Then they’ll tell you they will do you a favour by cancelling your order rather than rectifying it.Be prepared to be disappointed if there are any issues with your orders!Better still buy what you want at a different outlet",12 December 2019,GB

Fry,I have made over 5 calls to Nike over the past 50 days totaling more than 2 hours of wasted time trying to get a refund for the wrong shoes Nike sent me.  The website says refunds take 1-2 days!!!  Avoid this company like the plague.We were sent 'too small shoes' as gift.  Nike.com initially refused to exchange them but eventually agreed to the exchangeOne month passes from initial order - Nike.com sends the same 'too small' shoes again ignoring my request to size up to from W 10 to W 11.5.  Nike.com insists they cannot exchange shoes two times and claim they cannot fix their own mistake.  They say they'll issue a gift card so I can repurchase the shoes.  They also promise to send coupons for 15% off next purchase and free shipping due to the inconveniences that were never received.  Two months pass and still no gift card or coupons.  I call again and this time request a refund.  They want to refund me a lower sale price which I insist is immoral and corrupt.  They tell me the refund will be issued 1-2 weeks.  Three months pass and still no refund.  Call again and get the same run around.  They have now sent notice that I should be receiving a gift card even though I have insisted multiple times on a refund.,11 December 2019,US

barry davenport,"I have bought only Nike Air trainers since they were released in the uk many years ago and always loved them. However the last 2 pairs i bought, 1 of which were custom design and not cheap, have literaly fell apart in a matter of a few miles but it was a few months later so no chance of refunds. These were only ever used for light walking and driving and were not used every day as i still had older trainers that i used for work etc. It seems like they are designed to fail after a short period so you buy more but maybe it will have the opposite effect as I know a few people who have stopped buying Nike trainers because of the poor quality. At around £150 a pair for a few miles of normal walking it just doesnt add up. Such a shame greeds won again after so many years but im not throwing good money after bad!",09 December 2019,GB

I spend over 30min on the phone with this girl who was rude and unhelpful - asked me numerous times for my home address and bank details. When I asked her to confirm the address as it seems that she wasn't sure about the information, she refused it and used GDPR as an excuse. I asked for her manager and she told me that she didn't want to pass it on. I can't believe a brand such as Nike would provide such low standard service to their customers. Don't buy it, definitely not through 02076604453 - the only number you can access Nike and it is based in Dubline (not London).",09 December 2019,GB

G james,"Wow, for a big company like Nike the way they run their website and customer service is shocking! All I want to do is order some trainers and every time I get an error code. I tried numerous cards including family and friends cards and still no joy. I speak to customer service and they say my cards are on a 24 hour block because I failed to enter correct information. What? on 3 separate cards the details are wrong? Please. They aren't interested in taking any responsibility whatsoever. They tried saying that the name had to be typed the exact way it appears on the card. Well it goes to show how much they know about their own website because it doesn't even have a box prompting you to type your name as it appears on the card, just first name and then last name. I don't know how Nike make business online I really don't. I've just been left annoyed and frustrated from this whole experience and I'm determined never to return to this site again. This is the 2nd time in 2 months I've had this issue so it seems like there is no urgency to sort their website out. Embarrassing.",07 December 2019,GB

I returned the sweats the same day I received them & have now been waiting 9 days for them to process the ‘return’ as they will not send the correct item until they have checked the returned item even though it was their mistake. I’ve repeatedly asked to speak with a supervisor only to be told ‘we’re working hard to resolve your issue & will notify you by email when your item has shipped’.

Tom Parle,"Terrible service from this huge company who should know better. Ordered some trainers in the Black Friday sales - they then hung on to my order until the sales were over only to tell me that, although their website stated my size was in stock, they didn't have them in stock and that their website does not always truly reflect the reality of what items they have in their warehouse. All the other sites I could have ordered the same shoes from are now out of stock so I lost out due to very poor inventory management from Nike.com. I have never had this problem shopping elsewhere - other big companies such as Amazon are able to get the basics of online shopping in place to ensure the experience for the customer gives them confidence to return in the future. I will not be shopping at Nike.com anymore as it is too risky.",06 December 2019,GB
Wasay,"I bought two pairs of sneakers from their website during the weekend and paid extra for 2 day shipping. However, on the day they were supposed to arrive, I got an email from them saying that they never even shipped them. I called them and they basically send they're sorry and that I have to expect them to arrive 8 days from the day they were supposed to arrive (not even 8 days from when I ORDERED them).....extremely disrespectful. I have never had a company handle their own mistakes like this before. I purchased a pair of Yeezys from Adidas on the same day and they arrived first thing in the morning (also purchased with 2-day shipping). Nike's customer service is essentially useless as well, all they do is parrot the same script to you and until you go away. They seem to legitimately not care about their customers. Just to give a comparison to a similar situation. I had ordered whey protein with 2-day shipping from Amazon a few months ago. They ended up delivering it to the incorrect mail room in my apt complex. I called them the day of to inform them of what happened. They ended up actually giving me ANOTHER one for FREE with NEXT DAY shipping and I received it early the next morning. That SHOWS me that they genuinely care for their customers if their willing to ship and entire 5 Lbs package with next day shipping for free. Im not expecting a free product from Nike, I just want my package to arrive the day I ordered. And if it's not shipped the day it was supposed to, then tell me THEN, not the day it was supposed to arrive. They promised they'd give me shipping details the day I had called them, still no information. What kind of ridiculous service is this? Why would I ever want to buy or recommend anyone to buy their products ever? Now after reviewing the other reviews on here, even the QUALITY of the shoes  are questionable. So, I guess I have to wait and see if I need to return the shoes because the soles start coming off. Even then they probably won't refund it.",05 December 2019,US

Ginger Callison,"I have never had a customer service experience as bad as I had with Nike. While I am almost certain I entered our business suite number in the address portion of my order, Fed Ex explained that it didn't show up on their order information. Perhaps I left it off...but when I tried to correct the information I was unable to provide this information witho Fed Ex. Fed Ex explained that they were unable to fix the address on the package because of ""restrictions"" placed by Nike. Fed Ex then explained that I had to call Nike directly to fix my address. So, after at least 20 minutes on the phone with Fed Ex, I called Nike. When I did (after also being on hold), I was told this had to be ""escalated"" by the customer service rep, even when I provided the tracking number, my name, phone number, etc. to them.I will never, ever order from Nike again. I wasted at least an hour on the phone and finally wound up canceling my order.I've never taken the time to write an online review before--that's how annoying this experience was.

I quickly emailed customer service and had a reply the following day from Denzell who explained that the code expired at 12 midnight on Central European Time and not Greenwich Mean Time.  I batted a few emails back and fore asking them to honour the discount as clearly this was a computer glitch as the system obviously knows we are in the UK as the pricing is in GBP and not Euros, therefore the deal should have been available until the end of Friday.  They did not budge and loyal customers don't seem to count for anything, they seem to prefer to have disgruntled customers than happy customers!

Richard A. Forbes,"Nike does not stand behind the quality of their products and after being a customer for 25 years, I will never ever buy another Nike product again because of it. I had a pair of nike running shoes tear apart after 4 months of use. I contacted the Nike store where i purchased them and all they could say was they had a 90 day return policy and they could do nothing about the bad quality shoes that tore apart. I contacted enough Nike people until I was speaking with the Senior Customer Management rep and after 3 phone calls their best solution was to say they stand behind their 90 day policy instead of standing behind delivering a high quality product. In the best case scenario I hoped Nike would offer to exchange the shoes for a pair that were not torn apart, but they didn't think that was a reasonable request. Nike did not even think to offer even a 50%, 25%, 10%, 1% discount on a new pair of shoes. Their best suggestion was to go buy a new pair of shoes and hope the next pair don't rip apart. I am absolutely appalled at this level of service from such a reputable company. I have sold my existing stock holdings I had with Nike, and I will never purchase a single Nike item for myself or as a gift again.",29 November 2019,CN

Contacted this company on various instances inbetween these dates to try & get an understanding on when/what is being delivered etc, they couldn't be specific. Upon receiving my last delivery on the 23rd I contacted them once again on the 26th to inform them that I was still 1 item missing from my total order, they told me this has been cancelled from the order due to it not being in stock; to re-iterate I placed this order 22 days before I was told an item was not in stock, is this acceptable? When I asked why it wasn't in stock but it was when I initially placed the order, I was told that my order was delayed for 20 days due to a glitch on their system, & when they went to pick it at the warehouse on the 22nd it was no longer in stock (they couldn't tell me what the glitch was). Apparently I will be refunded in 5-9 business days - however, I won't be holding my breath. The operator towards the end of the call politely offered to check if the item was now in stock for me (3 days after cancelling my order I had waited 22 days for). I'm fine thanks.",26 November 2019,GB

Then they advise me to call back in two days which I did. Placed order again promised free next day delivery. That was 4 days ago. Still no sign of trainers.

Artem,"Ordered Nike online while being in the UAE. Was concerned about the return but Nike assured me that I have plenty of time to make a free return and it would be very easy in case my order doesn't fit.Order arrived, it didn't fit, I issued a return on the website. The delivery guy didn't come on the expected date and 3 days already have passed. Nike.com customer support told me that they can't do anything about it since the purchase was made outside of the US. They gave me 2 phone numbers, a toll-free one that doesn't exist and a local UAE one that belongs to a partner SunAndSandSports. I reached those guys, and guess what? I can't get a refund for my order! Only exchange is possible and ""they are doing that only because I'm a Nike client""...So here I am, trying to exchange the order that didn't fit to something else instead of getting my money back.

Remon,"Had probably one of the worst e-commerce experiences this week with Nike.Started with a problem of a very 'bugged' website that had trouble with changing address details and deleting old address information stored. Kept popping back in the previous settings. Even with cookies/cache cleared, things would still not be processed correctly.Second problem: payment. Wouldn't allow me to pay and after three attempts, using different methods - all without success (due to the glitchy address settings). Jumped on a call with Nike and literally got the feedback: there's nothing we can do, you'll have to wait 24 hours and try again. So I figured to do it via another device/browser and use another payment method. This time it succeeded! YAY! However next morning when I checked on my Nike app, the order had been mysteriously cancelled without notification or any form of explanation as to why. I now had to go and make sure those payments got cancelled from my end in order for not wasting any money on a cancelled order by Nike.I went on the online chat support to get more information and they replied:-Thanks for your patience with us. I am very sorry to inform you that your order has been cancelled because we were unable to verify your billing information or it can also mean that payment details or other crucial information is missing or incompatible. Nike takes your security seriously. Due to the fact that we could not verify your PayPal details, we were unable to send out confirmation at risk of jeopardising your digital security.   For automatic system cancellations, no email is sent. This is a security measure for our consumers, due to the possibility of it being an unauthorised transaction.-'So a security measure?' without informing your customers is the right thing to do? Why not contact the customer and ask them for a confirmation what so ever?Anyway, so I ask for them to re-enable the order (it was an order of 11 items and I didn't feel like having to search them and add them again to make another order without knowing if this time it would work). Nike's reponse: -I am very sorry as we can't reinstate the cancelled order. As much as I would love to assist you with a new order, for security purposes, we don't want to capture any payment information within our chat transcript. We don't place order via chat or e-mail.-So I set aside my pride and start trying to add items to my basket again, then the next thing happens when I try to open the cart section (nike com/gb/en/cart): {""error_id"":""d1639aef-3936-426b-a1f5-e487ffe47575"",""errors"":[{""code"":30,""message"":""Forbidden access""}]}.So I clear all cookies/cache, relog into my account, everything appears to be as usual, but now every time I go into the cart section, it gives me the same error message. Unable to make any purchases what so ever.I'm starting to get annoyed by the poor level of quality and service provided so I ask through the same chat window with the support if they can file a complaint. Nike's reponse:-What I can do here is capture your feedback. As of the moment, we don't have a complaint process online, Remon.-So you have:- A flawed billing system / account management- Poor support- No space for complaints directly with your support chat- You can't help me sort out the order and reactivate itWhat is the point of even buying from Nike then? Is the product that good, that you can have one of the worst user experiences and basically leave your customers with nothing, not a single form of help?EDIT: So whilst writing this review I have been online with chat support and trying to at least get some form resolve. But now the support typist I'm with has been 'typing....' for the last 35 minutes or so. The chat transcript is laughable (you'll see how little they care or do for their customers).Another thing that happened now is: The app on my phone and my user account on Nike are inaccessible. The horror story continues.EDIT2: It's been almost a week now and my app is functional again. The order that failed has been somehow erased entirely from this system. I was ensured by Nike employee over the phone that a Manager would be in touch with me, which hasn't happened to this day. Nike... what on earth are you doing?EDIT in June 2020: Half a year later and Nike still hasn't taken the effort to even read or reply to this post. It's a shame Nike.EDIT in February 2021: Nike still hasn't replied or given any care about this. Bye Nike!",06 November 2019,GB

Wayne,I will give Nike a negative 5 for customer service. I bought a pair of Nike shoes a month ago for my son and the shoes have a hole worn in the toe. One month old shoes should not be worn out already. I called Nike customer service yesterday and the said that I would have to send back the shoes to them and the would look at whether or not it was a manufactured defect or just worn out.  So they said there is a 2 year warranty for them but o will have to send them the shoes back at my cost for shipping and in 5-7 weeks they would either send me new shoes or send me the old ones back. I walked into a Nike store and the manager said that he has seen this a lot with this type of shoe and if I had bought the shoes with them he would take them back but I didn’t buy them from Nike. We got the shoes from famous footwear and there policy is they would take them back if they were not worn. So I’m stuck in this position now I ha e to buy my son another pair of shoes a month after I bought the other ones and pay to ship them back to Nike and wait to see if they will do the return. I think that their policy sucks and being I have the receipt that says when I bought them should stand for something.,16 October 2019,CA

Deger O.,"I received a gift card as a birthday gift. I didn't use it for couple of months since the website says it doesn't expire. When I tried to use it in a nike store (after picking items I wanted to buy), the cashier told me that I could only use it online. When I went to the online store, the card gave an error. I called customer services and after waiting for many minutes to speak to someone, and for that someone to speak to someone else... she told me that the card had expired, but that ""I shouldn't worry"" because they would issue me a new one.... which would take 3 - 5 days and she would call me to give me the new card number... The story is clear and honest.. The issue may seem to have been solved. BUT imagine buying a 'gift' for someone and him/her having to go through such a hassle to be able to use that gift?! This is not customer-centred service, it is organization-centred service! This was even clearer when the lady said she could only call me (and not email me) because she is a phone-agent. Apparently phone agents and email agents are different people sitting in different departments and the organisational system does not allow them to communicate with each other. Unbelievable!

This is not a material or manufacturing fault therefore we will not be replacing your shoes. Seriously, after 4 months of wear on a pair of $280 vapormax runners and they failed and it's not a manufacturing or quality control issue ?

Km,Ordered shoes and socks for my son 1 year ago. Received a shoe size box with just the socks inside and a packing slip saying both were in there. They did apologize and send the shoes after i contacted them. I figured it was a fluke and ordered shoes and socks again this year. Received tracking info for both and then an email stating my packages were delivered. Nothing came. I contacted them and the shoes were out of stock.  Crazy and ridiculous.,07 September 2019,US
Liz ( Coatbridge ),"Really bad customer service from Nike, tried to order football boots for my son and Nike rejected my payment 3 times, they said my billing address was wrong and I had to contact my bank, which I did and there was nothing wrong with my card, the 3rd time I tried ordering them when they phoned me the order went through but no email followed up and I had to phone them again  just received another call saying I was to try again and low and behold the football boots are out if stock very very poor from Nike I'm afraid.",06 September 2019,GB
Paul,I bought nike vapormax for $250 just about 4 months before and now the shoe is getting hole on the side where big toe goes and when I explained everything to customer service they told me to send it to their claims department which is in america and when i paid for shipping charges. I waited for like 3 weeks and then they told me its a normal wear and tear .... seriously like only 4 months before i bought $250 shoes and they are getting a hole because of wear and tear then it means nike quality is worst if their shoes can't even work for 6 months. Even i paid the importing fee afterwards when i got them back from their claim department. Means i paid 350 dollars for this worst shoes ever. This is not the first time before this when i bought nike air max for about $200 they even got ripped from the mesh but i didn't tried to call customer service. But this time I am really very surprised from thier customer service. I will never buy nike again in my life.Worst company worst quality.,06 September 2019,CA

Evedavid48,"My son bought me my first pair of nikes for mother’s day in May , they were on sale for 130$ from 180$ after 2 months the sole wore down and the rubber separated , a hole inside the shoe formed where my big toe would go , I called Nike  and explained my situation I still had receipt , they said I can ship them back on my dime and if they feel that this damage is NOT normal wear and tear or there is a defect they will ship me a new pair and if it is normal wear and tear they will ship them back to me but they are not responsible if the shoes get lost on the way back . So I went to the store where I bought them and they did an even exchange 😁 that was in July when I got the second pair now we are in September and the same thing is happening to this pair rubber on sole is separating, worn down rubber on the sole , hole where big toe is inside shoe . These shoes are garbage I will never buy them again and the warrantee on the shoes is bull   I buy 35$ sneakers that last me 6 months to a year and I can’t even get two full months out of these",06 September 2019,US

Sandy,"So Disappointed!!If you want to order customized shoes fromNike.Com do not do it!!! We have been waiting for months! We were supposed to receive last week, or earlier, but then got an email that they would be another two weeks. When contacting customer service they couldn’t do anything but give 15% off of a future order....I really like Nike should do better. Now I know to use Amazon more!! Do not buy on Nike.com.",05 September 2019,US
John Wigsten,"I placed an order online on July 29, 2019 based on the information provided on the myniketeam.com that stated the uniforms would ship in 4 - 5 business days from order placement.    On August 6, 2019 I followed up as I had not heard a thing from them.  They replied on August 7, 2019 with ""Please be advised: Blank stock product (including uniform bottoms) - Estimated ship time is 7 business days.  Arrival time is based on ship method chosen at checkout (+ 5-7 days for ground, +2 days for expedited). You should receive an email with tracking shortly! Thanks, Nike TEAM""On August 9 I followed up again as I still had not received any tracking information.  The replied with ""Hi John, Your order is still processing. Please be advised this is a very busy time for Nike Team as we work to fulfil back to school orders for the 85,000 schools we serve. We are working diligently to process and ship your order as quickly as possible. Your understanding and patience are greatly appreciated. Tracking will be sent as soon as it ships via email.""On August 17, 2019 they sent this to me""Hi John, I’ve spoken with my team and the shipment to Guam needed some routing assistance. The carrier was an issue, but traffic moved this over to UPS WW Exp on Wednesday so you should receive a tracking number soon.""On August 24, 2019 I asked for tracking information as I still had not received this information.  They replied with this ""Hi John, Here is the tracking number we have for you via FedEx: 415737046220""So not it went from being shipped UPS WWE back to FEDEX.  On August 28, 2019 I followed up again on shipment as the FEDEX tracking site only showed they had created a shipping label.  I was told when following up to call FEDEX.  I did and FEDEX told me the order had not been tendered (called for pick up) by NIKE to FEDEX.August 29, 2019 ""they told me they are looking into this.""So now my order has been sitting in Dayton, Tennessee 30 days since ordering on July 29, 2019.  I asked on 3 separate occasions for an email address, phone number and name of someone I could call to discuss with someone but never received a thing from them until September 5, 2019 when they told me ""We cannot give out the names and emails of the personnel on our team in charge of shipping over in our factory.  Nike Team is a brand new site and unfortunately there have been a few glitches in our system which is one of the reasons there were issues getting you your order in a timely fashion. The confusion can be attributed to the training of new employees and we apologize for the frustration this has caused you. We do hope you accept our sincerest of apologies.A complete and utter failure on their part.  Then I call NIKE.com # 1 800 344 6453 to be told I am dealing with a partner of Nike and there is nothing they can do.  I was not asking nor did I ever ask for a discount for their failure.  A little empathy, training and customer service would have sufficed.  So now I will only buy Adidas, Asics or UA when buying my running gear, team clothing etc.  Thanks for taking ownership of your vendors Nike!",05 September 2019,GU
Natasha A Smith,"I will never order from Nike.com again! I ordered shoes for my daughter and backpacks for my boys. I received the shoes no problem. I returned the shoes because they were too small for her. I was still waiting on the backpacks when I received a notice that the bags were being sent back due to bad postal code. Called them they informed me they already received the shoes and weren't sure why I didn't receive the bags or how the postal code changed. I explained why I was so overwhelmed and stressed out from this situation because school was going to start in a week and now I have to spend my weekend driving around town to find them backpacks. They offered to comp(refund) the order and send it back out to me. I was so great full & ecstatic I wouldn't be spending my entire weekend looking for other bags. They took my address 4 times to make sure it was correct! Well I never received it! The order was sent back AGAIN for the same reason! I called back and they escalated to a supervisor. I've called several times to ask when the sup should be contacting me and to no avail. Now it's been 30 days so I call again only to get in touch with a supervisor who offered me a discount on my next purchase!!! There was nothing the sup could do about the comp order I never received. So for all of the time, overwhelming stress, hardship, frustration, hurt, and anger they have caused my children and I we were offered a 20% discount on our NEXT order!!! Yeah that's never going to happen! Like we'd place our trust in them to get it right the next time and on top of that they couldn't make things right this time! No thank you!",05 September 2019,US
Sara Anson,"Ok product is cool, but their ads- such as the bead/ball commercial where a woman asks about the shoe, referring to them as 'balls' comes off as if only conceited, rude af people buy their product.

I was very confused about it so I called them and they told me that it must be the billing address and that I didn't enter it correctly. I changed it and I sent my order again and guess what. It got canceled again. I called them again and I ordered the shoe trough the phone. My order got canceled again called them again and they told me that it must be my bank's fault. Went to the bank and everything was fine. After that, I tried to order again and it just showed me 'error'. I gave up honestly. I never had so many issues ordering online. I really like their sneakers and it's such a shame that their site is this bad.",02 September 2019,GB
Cherry Ryder,"No stars.  I bought a pair of Nike trainers costing £65 from Sports Direct which lasted 3 months just walking, no running.  The shop wouldn’t accept them back saying it’s wear and tear so I got in touch with Nike directly .  The examined the shoes and agreed they were faulty and gave me a code to buy another pair.  I couldn’t see anything suitable so contacted them. They said I had to have a replacement from their website ITS THEIR POLICY.  After numerous phone calls and e.mails and the supervisor promising to phone me back, which he didn’t, nothing was done.  They just expected me to pay the extra money.  Why not just send me a gift voucher to buy another pair?  I know why because their prices are way higher than any other retail outlet.  Nike you should be ashamed!",02 September 2019,GB

Susan Mills,"I placed an order for my sons football cleats over the summer, they stated customized but we did not customize them at all, bought as is, delv stated by 8/29 which was great bc that was the first game that he needed them by, called last week to just make sure that they would be delv and i was told no that they wouldn't be delivered until 9/6 now bc they were waiting on something, never rec'd no email no phone call to advise me of this, called and was very upset all they could say was sorry, asked for a manager or supervisor of course could never speak to one, was told one would call me back within 2 hrs, nope no phone call at all. now this morning I rec'd an email stating now they would not be delv until 10/8, what the he**, what in the world is the problem now, by then the season would be almost over and why would i need cleats then. i picked these cleats bc these were the only ones that we could find that were required and now we can not find another pair so i have no clue what to do now so it looks like NIKE will cause my son not to be able to play this year. they care nothing for their customers, you can never call and speak to upper management or supervisor, cant contact corporate bc they have no phone# to give or nothing. I advise people not to deal with NIKE at all bc they do not care about their customers at all and could careless of your needs or feelings, they just pretty much say owell, we can issue you a refund but cant explain nothing else!!!!!!!!!! I give no stars at all bc they deserve nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They also said that my order has been elevated but not sure what that means to them except to sit back and do nothing bc nothing has been done or said except  sorry. this is unacceptable and is not right. Asked for corporate number and they said oh we don’t have a number for them but we can have them send you an email, well it’s funny how google has corporate number and funny how Nike was just in the news about something else",28 August 2019,US

Have contacted Nike numerous of times via email but have received no response. I have sat on the phone to their call centre for hours on end to no avail.I have spent a lot of money on a product that I have not received and NO ONE wants to take any responsibility for the parcel and I am having to foot the bill.Coming from two major companies, Nike UK and UPS this is SO disappointing.I am so frustrated.It’s been a few months and I have received neither my money nor an apology nor my wife’s shoes.I am a frequent customer of Nike but after this I will NEVER purchase from Nike Uk again.",16 August 2019,ZA

They, for the 1st time, were very uncomfortable and we're defective. I spent my money to return them to the company with hopes of a different pair( no money requested) only to have them returned with an excuse to return them to the provider( online). Michael Jordan is my real life hero, which is primarily why I shop. All I can say or recommend, is that the quality was not there and this billion dollar company decided to place a certain burden on their longtime consumer. Farewell Nike.

Dayron Ruiz,"Wow, I’m kind of relieved in a bad way, if that makes any sense. I was expecting to see five star reviews across the board, but it turns out Nike really is an incompetent and neglectful company. For the money we spend buying their products, they should be a little more competent. Their customer service “experts” are amateurs at best. I ordered a pair of customized Prestos and asked for sizing advice for men. The “expert” reassured me to go with a smaller whole size as they don’t make them in half sizes. Two weeks later I received the shoes and they don’t fit. Turns out they are for women and they don’t make the sneakers for men in those colors right now. I think that should have been assessed and addressed in the beginning. It doesn’t take and “expert” to figure that out.",08 August 2019,US
Lea Donofrio,"I ordered 2 pair of custom Nikes for my wedding (10 days away) understanding that I may not have them within their 2 week shipping period. I spoke to Marj through live chat who let me know he would look into expediting the order (if at all possible). He was kind, approachable and at least offered to try. I unfortunately got disconnected from him and then spoke to Rihana who displayed a lack of customer service. She was quick to explain ""once an order is placed it can not be modified"". I then explained that he was looking into it and she continued ""it says at check out you cant"". Extremely rude, lack of care for customers and lack of finding solutions for customers online.

It was a simple question and it should have taken  5 minutes to be resolved but it instead took me almost 40 minutes to get a clear answer out of him.

I contacted them daily to ask for my money back for an item i cancelled and was never even received by me.  I kept being told there higher team will look into it.  I was asked to provide a bank statement to prove I had been charged as they clearly thought I was lying! I supplied this straight away and still I was told there higher team would look into it.

I was on the phone with them for over 2 hours, and they cancelled my order twice and re-ordered everything, then missing one word. I will remove my membership after today and will not shop with Nike again.

Eman Resu,"Laziness, lies and then some.TLDR: Nike does not care about their customers, except for getting their money. Nike won’t give you a shoe suggestion based on a given criterion / customer needs if you ask a question that requires just a little bit of research. They also lie right to you and won’t even think twice about it.Full review:I’ll keep this as “short” as possible, but it is a long one. For reference, the one star review pertains to Nike as a company and one manager who lied to me / mislead me. This does not apply to the representatives that spoke to me. They were fine.Background:I have been wearing the Nike Air Pegasus for 13+ years. I am a forward foot runner as well, feel free to look that up if you want, there are videos on youtube that show the difference in slow motion of the 2 kinds of runners. For those that don’t want to look that up just know there are heel toe runners and forward foot runners. Heel toe runners can run comfortably in nearly anything, even combat boots. Forward foot runners sadly cannot. We require flexible shoes that bend near the center.I noticed that the Nike Air Pegasus 32 and above were not very good shoes for a forward foot runner at all. They did not bend much, and when they did bend it took way too much force to do so. That means it puts a lot of force on the bridge of my foot. That means potential injury. In January of 2019 I then called up Nike.com to ask them one basic question, with the expectation that they would get back to me, boy was I wrong. I asked Nike to compare the design of the Nike Air Pegasus 27, 28, 29 and 30, relative to the sole, the design of the sole, where the bend in the sole was, the PSI it takes to bend the front of the shoe back and all other aspects of it. Ie, I want something very close to that shoe in design. I wanted to know what shoe(s) they make are closest to those shoes in terms of specs, numbers. Not a hard question in my eyes, especially given that they have the data. (With the information i know now, i guess i was speaking ancient greek to them, asking for the meaning of life...) They said repeatedly that they would get back to me and they never did. I called and called. Each time I would call they would not have my original question(s) I asked. Each time I called I had to repeat the question, and then they would say that they would call me back. Nobody ever did. This went on for SIX months. SIX. The third to final time I called I was told by somebody, I think a manager, that the information I am after is proprietary and they cannot give it out. At this point I asked just for a shoe recommendation then after they research it. That did not go well and I ended up hanging up in frustration. The best part happened after that third to last call. I called a third party company that gave me the information I had been asking Nike about for six months. They just nonchalantly gave it to me over the phone on the FIRST telephone call. Nike claims something is proprietary, yet another company has the data I am after and gladly gives it to me. Nike does not keep their secrets very well hidden. If the data I was after was/is proprietary, they need to hire better security. Their testing lab seems to have a massive leak or a mole.That third party company suggested a shoe that worked for my needs and I placed an order. After testing the shoe out I then bought two more pairs from Nike, as that site ran out of the shoe. I will NEVER go back to the company. With their poor customer service, lies, deceit, and outright refusal to suggest a shoe that would work for my needs (based on data, not just guess work) they burned any bridges built over a 13+ year period with me. They do not care about their customers at all, at least based on how they acted towards me. They won’t do basic research to help find a shoe that will work for a customer with specific needs, even though they are the ones that has the data on their shoes. Lazy, VERY lazy. Terrible customer service and outright lies. DO NOT BUY FROM NIKE.",19 July 2019,US

Yoosha,"Placed an order on the 25th of June from Nike, it was the SNKRS section of the website, where limited edition or exclusive items were released.The sneakers made it to my country, but there's no movement of my package thereafter, and Nike tried investigating for the past 2 weeks so I've given up on waiting. It is the 13th of July and still no sneakers. Nike suggested that I request a refund. I placed a request for a refund, and now I await an email within 3-5 business days saying that my refund has been processed.:(",13 July 2019,ZA

Nicola Schofield,"Super disappointed with the way Nike.com dealt with us! When visiting London we bought our daughter some high performance running tights for £80.00. She’s had them for about 4 weeks and a hole has appeared which I think was tiny when we bought them and unnoticeable. The hole has grown and when we called customer services to ask if these could be replaced, as our daughter had cut the itchy ticket out they said there was nothing they could do! Wow how helpful! I think this is a terrible way to treat customers who regularly buy Nike products and I would recommend you always ensure the expensive item you purchase is in perfect condition before you leave the shop. Otherwise you could be as disappointed as us!",11 July 2019,GB
Chris,"Bought two pairs of shoes from Nike.com. Needed to return one pair because they didn't fit. Here's the problem: Nike didn't provide free return shipping. At first glance this might not seem like a big deal, but I think it's unacceptable. Nike.com charges full retail price, so they're taking not only their manufacturer's profit but also the profit that would normally go to a retailer. Other retailers like Zappos.com manage to provide free return shipping while not taking this double profit. Even when retailers charge for return shipping they will often at least provide the customer with a prepaid shipping label allowing easy drop off. I was forced to take my package to a US post office or else pay double the shipping cost at a UPS store. Bottom line - returning a pair of shoes to Nike.com was expensive and time-consuming. I would never buy directly from them again.",11 July 2019,US
Amalia,I bought my daughter a pair of $155. Soccer cleats one year ago and within that year the cleats toebox has separated from the sole of the shoe.

Raju,"Recently I have ordered a 42 mm Apple watch series 3 from Nike online because there was a sale, and so the watch was coming at a lower price. Unfortunately they have delivered a 38 mm watch.I have reported the issue to customer services, but they were not ready to send me the 42 mm watch. Instead they have asked me to return the 38mm watch and place a new order for the 42 mm watch. Surprisingly they don't have a courier pickup service and as a result they have asked me to go to the post office return the watch. Once I email the post office receipt to Nike, they say that they will refund my money.After quite an unpleasant conversation with their customer service, I tried to place the order, but the 42 mm watch was sold out. Now they are suggesting to wait until the product is available BUT there is NO GUARANTEE that I will get this watch at the price that I originally ordered it at. If I want to purchase the same watch from them, I have to pay an extra £164. THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING! Now because of Nike's mistake, now I have to pay extra money.This is totally unfair and they don't care for customers. In addition to this they have the most terrible and cruel customer service. Today I have phoned them up, and the person on the other side of the phone, just said: ""I'm very sorry"", and ""I can't help you anymore"".If that's not enough of a tragedy for you, THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT! I just can't stress this enough, I'm so OUTRAGED.",08 July 2019,GB

Patrick Bentley,"I think one star is too much for Nike.we all have freedom of choice and they can choose to pull their shoes because someone doesn't like being a United States citizen.He could choose to move to Canada but oh yes they had slavery too, or he could move to Mexico and oh darn the Spanish brought slaves to Mexico.Why don't we just send him wherever he wants to go but not in our country. I'm a veteran my ancestors are veterans we came here after the civil war none of us owned slaves had anything to do with slavery.To attack our country because of his belief and for Nike to back him is a poor choice.I will never buy a Nike swoosh item again. I will encourage my alma mater to the best of my ability with the rest of the alumni to stop purchasing anything from Nike we have to stop this craziness now it's just not right.He is no better than the president at trying to divide our country we need unity not division this is today not 200 years ago that's how I feel",06 July 2019,US
Rodney,"Nike is a very anti-American. They listened to the voice of one person to make a negative decision not to sell a shoe that had the first US flag design on the shoe. This is so disappointing.  The flag represents our country and how much we have grown and changed since becoming a nation.  I fought for it and still respect it.  The flag  is more than one person or company.  Just ask people at Fort McHenry in September 1814 who hoisted the US Flag high during bombardment and they kept the flag flying. The flag over Ft McHenry had 15 stars and strips to represent our young nation, Through wars and conflict people died to defend the US flag and the great country it represents.  Long live USA and flag that flies over it.",06 July 2019,US

It's a total disgrace and slap to the ideals for which our country was founded on.If they actually opened a history book, then they would understand many members of the Continental Congress were against the institution of slavery. However, to stand against the tyrant King George III, slavery would have to be tabled for a later date simply because the most pressing problem was winning the war after declaring our Independence. The flag that everyone is talking about is also referenced to the first American Political Cartoon by someone called Benjamin Franklin, Join or Die and has a snake with the different colonies aka Sons of Liberty. Also Nike has a double standard by hiring these sweatshops in SE Asia under very poor conditions. Nike only cares about profit and much of this is all marketed and simply a stunt to gain more exposure. I don't know who is worst, Nike or Disney!",05 July 2019,US
Christian Tenant,"Bought a pair of Nike Air Max that were $200 retail and after a month they were creaking Nike wanted nothing to do with it.

We spend a fortune at Nike, not a chance in hell will we do so anymore! Spend a few thousand a year at Nike, never again!!! They don't care about their customers anyhow, only care about things like illegal immigration and Colin Kaepernick's fake hardship drama... Yet we bought anyway, no more!",05 July 2019,US
Maureen,"If I could have posted negative stars, I would have. This company does nothing but taut their anti-American sentiment on a regular basis. I had stopped buying their products after they chose the guy who decided to kneel for the anthem in the very country that gave him the opportunity to make millions of dollars a year for playing a game, and then Nike chose to take this fool's advice over a sneaker bearing the old Betsy Ross flag. Betsy Ross was a Quaker, and a staunch supporter of the abolitionists. But yet again, history is distorted, and nobody bothers to fact check what these clowns decide to spew and who decide they cannot function if there is an image that offends them. How about you get over yourselves, and use your influence, and money, to help do something about the present day slave trade that is worse today, than at any other time in history. I am so glad I decided to stick to my guns and continue to buy Under Armor for my son, who has, after many discussions, come to understand why our family will not support this company with our hard earned money.

Used to love a chance to visit the employee store but seems like it's all yesterdays junk in there. Lately have bought Adidas Boost- 2 pairs and husband is trying the golf shoes.

There is not one other person in the world that thinks that a Betsy Ross flag relates to slavery of the times.  Nike doesn't get it!  It's all about money to them.  Colin's deal had died and there was no more money!  Colin opens his mouth and creates money for himself, and Nike.  The only slavery here is that Colin's actions have made a slave out of Nike.  If he doesn't create an issue then he falls out of the news.  Well sir, you will not fall out of the news.  You are now embedded in history.  Martin Luther King was a great man.  A man who served his position with respect from all.  He wasn't shooting his mouth off.  He was a true defender of the people and his belief.  He had respect.  People followed him.  No one is following you.  Your platform only creates descension and hatred.  Nike is just a slave to a really bad idea and cause.  Question for Nike:  Why did you pick this loser?

But it the most beautiful place on the planet and has been for last 243 years. We as American's need to love and respect the flag, EVERY FLAG through history, especially the Betsy Ross Flag. Betsy Ross was a part of history and loved America, loved people...ALL PEOPLE, no exceptions...NONE.I cannot even imagine anyone, especially NIKE to take a stance on saying the American Flag is not beautiful, it is the most beautiful symbol of opportunity and peace on the planet. When Betsy Ross decided to sew cloth together to symbolize how great we are, the world was in a place with no freedom, only tyranny. The flag has been a symbol of America, which don't get me wrong, but gave Nike their opportunity for success as well. Now they want to spit on the flag  and spit on every American. What Nike has done is the most selfish, unAmerican act of throwing out what has made them great. Isn't it funny, someone at Nike thought it was a great idea to put the flag on the shoes in the first place, which is how we see America in the eyes of Americans' only to pull it off in an act of disgrace, i really can't believe it, i am astonished. I am just one person and obviously i do not mean anything to Nike, But i promise I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING NIKE AGAIN AS LONG I LIVE. I am throwing out my thousands of dollars of Nike equipment in the trash and not giving it to charity, i wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing that someone is walking around in the most UnAmerican Brand in the world. Just another company spitting on America, i hope they go out of business.",02 July 2019,US
Me,For my part you can take your business out of our country to some other country has and is perfect. Nike will not be in my home in the future and I hope your share prices drops off the table.I am offended by your action of removing my flag. Now what? Don’t want to do anything? Acknowledge that coward and not me? That is not only offensive but discriminatory! The ball is in your court!,02 July 2019,US
Jerry Baxter,Since the recall of your latest shoe I have decided to never buy another Nike product. I am proud of our American heritage and you wouldn't be here without our history.,02 July 2019,US
Roger Nash,"I'm neither far right or far left, however, it's hard to imagine that a company such as your would fold to such extreme thoughts that somehow the American ""Betsy Ross"" flag is somehow racial and is a reminder of slavery.  It's a reminder of how this great country was founded and the brave men, both black and white, that gave their lives so this country might exist. Your leadership team doesn't know their history or care.  Sure, slavery was terrible and a regrettable part of our history but when one man simply states that he's offended by our flag and history and your company turns it back on this country it's a sad day.  For my part you can take your business out of our country to some other country has and is perfect.  Nike will not be in my home in the future and I hope your share prices drops off the tableRoger Nash",02 July 2019,US
Tim Wyse,I disgusted that Nike or any other company will cowtow to an anti -American SEMITE like colon kapernick. WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING? If he doesn't like the new shoes he doesn't have to wear them. Like many others Iv now lost ALL respect for the nike brand. If you want your customers back put the flag shoes back on the market and don't make the same stupid mistake twice.,02 July 2019,US
Edward Brockman,"Nike has gone the way of a strange form of political correctness that will destroy our country. It appears the few with big stages to complain gets their attention more than the consumer who loves and respects their country.

Irini,Foot Locker and Nike worst experience ever. Long story short my daughter bought Nike TN's on sale. After 3 months of wearing the soles were so worn down they looked like they were owned for years. Contacted Nike who had Foot Locker contact me(which took long till Matthew from there contacted me) he told us we could exchange for other color or shoe etc. We went to Foot locker only to have to deal with an annoying manager (Julianne) who tries to give me explainations as to why they are wore out and that she should not be wearing them everyday. Seriously?! Also to get a different color same shoe we had to pay the difference.  I forgot to mention my daughter in 20 and not an athlete just wears them to walk. So Julianne would not accept the email and tells me to come back another day so she could get in touch with Matthew. It takes me 1/2 hr by car and 1hr by bus I was not leaving without a shoe. So after 3 hrs of wasting my time she finally get in touch with Matthew who now tells me because they do not have the same color she needs to pay the difference to get a different color.  Well that is not what the email said. Did get  our money back but had been hassled few weeks before that from again Julianne who back then refused us an exchange or a refund. Also my son bought TN'S  full price which also fell apart. Those also were returned. So Nike and Foot Locker are absolutely horrible in customer service and quality of workmanship. What do I get in return for the stress and my wasted time? Nothing. Stay away from Foot Locker especially in Cairns Central Australia.,25 June 2019,AU
Jon B,"I have been an avid customer of Nike for going on 25 years. I buy new shoes every month just about. I ordered a rare color scheme shoe for my girlfriend's special birthday from Nike that they and only Finishline had in stock.The order said that it would get to me within 5-7 days. 6 days in and USPS notifies me that her package was there so I raced home to get it before she found yet. But... When I got home, there was no package. I called Nike immediately to have a customer service rep apologize and tell me that USPS actually lost the package aka probably stolen. He said that he would ship out the same order immediately and have it overnight shipped to make it in time for my girlfriends' birthday as she has wanted these shoes for some time.I call back after another 5 full days of hearing and seeing nothing. A new customer service rep said that nothing in my notes says that there was another package on its way. I was extremely upset and asked for a manager. No manager was around... shocking... and she said that she would offer me a refund. Even a refund wouldn't help with the issue Nike has now caused me but I accepted it.What do you know... Another 4 days go by and no refund. I call back today for the 2nd full hour I've been on the phone with them (should send them an invoice for my time) and she said she finally issued a refund. No offer of a discount, no sending the shoes on top of this massive f*** up.With how big Nike is and the experience they just gave to me they should be offering a refund and shipping the shoes out since their systems and processes are obviously broken and the customer shouldn't be the one paying the price.I will never be shopping at Nike again for how they handled this issue. Should always make your customers happy as you never really know how much reach the customer on the phone has with social media in 2019.",25 June 2019,US

Kyle,"They were able to charge my credit card flawlessly.  However, they haven't been able to figure out how to send the item that I actually purchased.  They keep sending the wrong thing.  Now they're refusing to send what I ordered, claiming it's no longer available, then refusing to send a very similar item, even though I offered to pay the $3 price difference. To get my money back for the item that they still haven't even sent me, they're trying to make me jump through hoops, which if I complied would cost me far more money in time away from my small business than the measly $15 I'd get back for returning a kid's shirt that I didn't even order.Crazy.",21 June 2019,US
Joseph Findlay,"Now first of all, I'd like to say that Nike shoes generally are of excellent quality and good value for money. That's not what my low rating is about, it's the customer service that I have issue with. I purchased a pair of running shoes, and when they arrived they appeared different to the photo. I contacted support, and they offered a return and exchange with a 15% discount and a promise that this manufacturing issue was a one off. After going through the hassle of this, the new shoes arrived... With exactly the same problem. I contacted support again, and they told me that this was actually how the shoes were supposed to be from the beginning, and that the images online were outdated. They gave me a 15% discount code for a future purchase, and that was that. I don't find this acceptable. They should have at least given me a partial refund for my troubles and their dishonesty, not something that is designed to make me give them even more money.",21 June 2019,GB

No a few days later the sneakers have ripped at the side where the laces tie up. worst sneakers  ever!!! Cannot believe the abysmal customer service as well. Nike says I need to pay to ship them to their head office and after 4-6 weeks they will let me know what they have decided. My 7 year old actually is crying each time another part breaks. This has never happened with New Balance sneakers that he had.,16 June 2019,CA

I travel to the Centralia location even though it is an hour from my house instead of 10 minutes. I would rather travel than deal with MLK people.

Dwight Bartlett,"Best Equipment In The World For Soccer Products!I was deciding between buying Nike and Adidas for my soccer equipment for Summer Season, and I decided to buy products from both companies. After initially buying soccer cleats from Nike and Adidas, I instantly realized the contrast in quality. The Nike Hyper Predators were the most comfortable cleats I had ever worn, and in terms of tightness and material design, they were exceptional. The Adidas Predators, on the other hand, were tight, developed with poor materials, and seriously strained my foot. After attempting to use both at practice, I realized that Nike was miles ahead of Adidas, and I decided to buy the entire Bundle.

There are now 'plus sized' shop-dummies on display in store to show what the kit would look like on larger people like me! It's so wonderfully refreshing to see this as for larger people, it can be really intimidating and humiliating to go into a sports shop like Nike.

So I placed my order for 2 pairs of toddler shoes for a wedding and 2 hats for free shipping. Anyways, I got 1 hat and the other 3 items were still in ""PREPARING TO PROCESS"" status. So I called to ask what is going on, and hoping it was an error. Turns out, they weren't even shipped! They said they will escalate the situation and give me 15% off for future orders. I was like give me the discount for this order because there won't be a next time. If you can't then cancel. Then they said they can't cancel the order only within 30 mins of the order. I said just refund me now since you still have 3 of the 4 items I ordered and I will just return the hat and you can refund that later. But no... they need to escalate this and get back to me in 3-5 business days? What's up with that? Never again, I suggest Foot Locker or just go to the store. Nike online is a joke.

And when asked to speak to higher ups or people other than the agents who can only give you but so much service, your told you will be emailed. And that's basically where it gets worst. Because these ""socalled"" supervisors leave you with no contact information. So for all I know it's the agent I just hung up with emailing me ha. What a joke. Highly disappointed. Ordered shoes from multiple other sites. You'd think a corporation this huge would do anything to solve your problems.

I ordered active wear and after a few washings the material starting showing signs of extreme wear. I thought about ordering their shoes but now will go with a different brand.

Rachael Williams,"I visited Nike resort world bank holiday weekend to buy my Son  some  trainers . I was emailed a 30% voucher by Nike on everything in their outlet stores . I asked a staff member for some  help with sizes of trainers and explained I had been emailed the voucher. He was very rude and said there were no offers on except for a few rails that had been on sale when I had visited a few days before . I tried to explain about the bank holiday weekend voucher but he continued to be rude and unhelpful .The  store was very busy and I didn’t want to wait in the que to pay to be told the same thing. I emailed Nike to complain when I got home , this was  a week ago and I haven’t even had a reply, I checked and no reply email has not gone into my junk mail.

Ron Kurimsky,"I returned a defective Nike Golf Bag and received a voucher to replace it on Nike.com. However, when I went to Nike.com I could not find a single Golf Bag on your site. So, I called customer service and they told me they were all out of stock. I don't accept (believe) that answer. That would be like looking for a cap/hat and telling me that every cap is sold out. It would be like going to the Ford Dealer and them telling me that all of their models are now sold out. It makes no sense. What is a customer supposed to do? Give up golf until you replenish your stock? Or, go elsewhere & buy a bag & use this voucher on something that I don't need? It seems like a very shabby way of doing business to me. Then, they can't even tell me when any bags will be back in stock - craziness. Is it one hour? One day? One month? One year? or never? Then when I ask to be notified when they are back in stock they tell me they can't do that - I should keep calling. Are you kidding me? This is 2019 ladies & gentleman. This business model sounds more like 1950 to me.",22 May 2019,US
David Johnson,"I purchased some Nike Tennis Shoes for my daughter and within two months, they had developed a hole in the toe area. This was from normal use while playing tennis. Obviously, any quality shoe should not develop a hole in them after only two months of normal use, so we filed a warranty claim with Nike. We had to spend $16 dollars shipping from the Bay Area in Northern California to the warranty address at Nike, which was the cheapest cost available (and unreasonably high).I received  a quick rejection to my claim, stating this was normal wear and tear. They left no way for me to respond to them. I faxed two letters successfully to their Corporate Office and didn't receive the courtesy of a reply. We are now all done with Nike in this family, since they do not stand by the quality of their product.",21 May 2019,US

Nadine Thom,"I ordered custom made NIKE Cortex shoes, which was fun designing. I really looked forward to it arriving- before I had a big event six weeks down the line. They arrived at 4 weeks- two weeks in advance! They came with no material covering the tongue of the shoe- there were foam sticking out at the back and at the front- visible. I paid R2000 for the shoes and delivery. After I complained and requested a return- they offered me 20% discount on my next purpose. They said they will send some one to pick up the shoes on a certain date- which they never did. I had to follow up again so they can send the courier to come and fetch it. Then they said they received the shoes and it will take 4 days to do a refund and the money should show within 10 days. NO REFUND was done! its been 12 days. It use to be great to wear NIKE, I have not had a problem of a day old in the past. But this is terrible- they promise products to a certain standard- dont meet the standard. Dont offer to fix it- and don't refund? Come on NIKE- you use to be great! You just lost a very old dedicated client.",17 May 2019,ZA
Alicia,"Literally bought a pair of socks and placed an order but had to ring to ask on the status because it was taking ages. Then apparently there was an issue with the delivery so they cancelled it without informing me but placed another order, admittedly at a good discount. Then, this order was supposed to be released from the warehouse but wasn’t for ages meaning I was ringing up frequently and took days on end for several people to be reminded - i left it for ages thinking it would arrive and they said they’d contact me but never did and rang them up again and they said it was supposed to arrive a week ago but clearly it hadn’t even been released from the warehouse even though I had reminded them every few days —until finAlly Micheal managed to cancel the order and place another order free of charge. Very happy with result and that with that particular customer service but the previous service was horrific.",17 May 2019,GB
Robyn Frear,"Disgusted in the company. I ordered 2 pairs of trainers for £170. Delivery date came an none showed up. When I rang them, they had CANCELLED my order and not notified me. After admitting their fault they asked me to re-place the order and they would be delivered today. So that’s £340 out my account. They’ve turned up today and I’ve been sent the WRONG SIZE. So now what they want me to do is send them back, place another order and pay AGAIN. Which means another week without my trainers because of ‘low stock’..well where are the original ones of the right size that were allocated to me when I placed the order? And them owing me more money back! I am absolutely fuming that such a largely recognised company can be so unprofessional and let customers down this much. Seriously put off from ever buying from Nike again.",16 May 2019,GB

Probably the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Made me never wanna buy from Nike website again (Yes, I used the official Nike website).",15 May 2019,CA

That way you don't have a mad rush of people trying to use the website at once.  Then announce who was ""randomly"" selected on the day of the drop.  See how easy that was.",11 May 2019,US

Dave,"If I could give no stars I would. Ordered goods for a 21st birthday present on 06/04/19. Received half of what I ordered. Contacted Nike as my order status for the remaining goods said they hadn't been dispatched after a week. Turned out there was a computer glitch and they would contact me as soon as they knew anything. A further 10 days pass, still nothing, contacted them again, still a computer glitch, asked them to cancel only to be told it was stuck in a system and they couldn't do it just yet, bearing in mind birthday has been and gone. 5 days later contacted them AGAIN as still nothing, they said they still weren't able to cancel because of a system glitch, a few days later, 24 days after the order, I receive an email to say it had been cancelled and the money would go back into my account in 5-9 days. Got home from work 9 days after they said they'd cancelled it to find the money still wasn't in my account, checked my emails to find one from Nike telling me the goods had been dispatched!!!!!! I don't want the goods, I want my money. Spoke to them AGAIN, they said they would recall the goods and put the money back in my account in 5 to 9 days!!!!! What sort of Mickey Mouse company is this??? A 3 week computer glitch has got to be some sort of record!!!!",09 May 2019,GB
Andrius Martynov,"Ordered the Nike Sb Nyjah Free size 8.5 shoes from here. Delivery was very fast and commendable but once the shoes came In it said size 9.5 on the outside packaging, I was very baffled so I tore open the packaging and on the actual shoe box it said a size 8.5 so I took it off as a simple printing mistake. Once I actually open up the box and tried on my shoes I instantly felt like I was wearing oversized shoes, and it seemed like I was actually wearing size a 9.5. I brushed this off and told myself that once the shoe broke in it would be fine, but after skating around in these shoes it really wasn't fine. The shoe was definitely oversized, still leaving a thumbs worth of space in the front of my shoes. So yeah not only did these guys give me the wrong sized shoe but they also lied to me which really says alot because I'm pretty sure these guys still manufacture their shoes in third world countries in sweatshops, so I definitely won't be buying any sort of nike related products again and I'll just stick with Vans. Those were my first nike branded purchase, and it's definitely my last one.",09 May 2019,GB

But, after 3 or 4 months the padding on the heel completely wore out.  So, I went out and bought another pair.  After another 4 months or so the exact same thing happened: the padding on the heel wore out and the plastic rubbed painfully against my foot.  I didn’t understand what was happening because I thought Nike shoes were supposed to be really good shoes.  I bought a third pair and a fourth pair and it kept happening!  I have now completely given up on Nike and I advise others to do the same! If this happened to me it will happen to you too, so avoid Nike shoes!",30 April 2019,CA

I was excited to do this in memory of their friend. Only to get one pair and not the other.  I called Nike and was told that they where waiting on material and it would be a month for the material to come in.  My question is why wasn’t I notified about the lack of material so I could find another company.  Now my son is upset because he didn’t get his in time for baseball and they will not be ready anytime during this baseball season.",27 April 2019,US

And unfortunately, the laces needed are specific to this cleat.. .so any old shoelace will NOT do.  Would have been happy to pay for replacement laces.  When I called Nike.com (and waited on hold), was told ""we dont sell replacement shoelaces"".  When I explained these $300 cleats are unusable without the laces, the CS rep laughed!  I asked to speak to a manager and was told :""a manager will not take your call about shoelaces"".  Zero help.

D Linehan,"So here is my take on NIKE sports..My daughter has used Nike soccer cleats for pretty much her entire career...Now at almost 20 years old and playing in college...We purchased a new pair of cleats this past august of 2018 for the season . At the start season, she noticed the cleats starting to delaminate on the inside front near her toes. She taped them up and played out her season because she didn't want to break in another pair of cleats. These were $100 plus, cleats mind you. As spring approaches and the team is talking about getting together again, we recently decided to return them to Nike to check out and evaluate. We received them back with a letter, stating that these shoes were ""manufactured"" over 2 years ago and no longer eligible for an inspection. Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. (These were brand new ..not a markdown,purchased at a very reputable local soccer store).So basically ...thx we got your money ...too bad. So all I have to say is ""SCREW YOU NIKE""...i will never buy another item of yours again.",30 March 2019,US

One of the main reasons for this is that they have switched almost all their menswear over to their new DriFit fabric.  This is 100% polyester and an absolute joke.Don't be fooled. 100% polyester is one of the cheapest fabrics that you can buy (I know because I work in garments production) and the quality of their t-shirt products reflect this ""cheapness"".

eva mulek,"Absolutely horrendous experience with one of the managers from first floor who by the way would not give me his name because he knew he was out of line! Bought a pair of Nike air trainers in January 2019 from Nike.com so a month ago for my husband. The trainers have been used on weekends only as my husband wear suits to work. We are now end of February so just over a month later the trainer’s sole looks to be peeling away and it looks pretty worn I have went online to read reviews which all suggest these trainers wear incredible badly and super quick so I took it in to Nike town store on oxford street to request a replacement or store credit. I have spent thousands at Nike over the past year or so because I am a personal trainer and wear s lot of gym clothes and never ever returned anything but when you spend over £120 for s pair of trainers especially as a gift you expect them to last for longer than a month. Anyway I was told to go on to the first floor and ask for a manager who was a tall coloured guy in his 30s I showed him the shoes and basically he told me that it’s impossible for the shoes to wear like this unless it was used constantly and for running. I told him they were used on weekends and not for running but regardless they are running trainers so why call it Nike air max running if you don’t want customers to run in them. Than he smiled at his colleagues  and insultingly said to me that people who wear trainers like this should buy timberlands and not Nike’s and that what was I expecting him to do because he is not willing to do anything with tgese and he has tgese trainers and his doesn’t look like this. Of course when I asked to see his trainers he couldn’t show them to me. He was rude, tried to insult me and basically encouraged me to not shop in NIke. When asking for his name he refused to give it to me than I told him I was gobig to contact Nike customer service tgan he has the nerves to smile in my face and say hope you have a nice day whilst he was laughing with his 2 colleagues. This behaviour from a manager is frankly unacceptable and I will thibk twice before I spend any more money at Nike . This so called manager shouldn’t be working in a customer facing role let alone left to be charge of anything. Needless to say that I am hugely disappointed in Nike  and will raise a claim via my Credit card company and sent a complaint letter to head office as the way I was treated is 1 unacceptable second the goods are not of satisfactory quality as per the sale of goods act.",24 February 2019,GB

Roger prince,"Nike in Sevierville Tennessee at the Tanger Outlet Mall seems to have staff that cares more about flirting with each other hanging out with each other sexually assaulting each other physically in front of customers, staff eating potato chips instead of helping customers. I would say Nike Sevierville Tennessee is trying to sell sex and also cares more about employees having fun time sex time hanging out time instead of helping customers. Fraternizing should not be allowed at work with young teenage kids working at Nike. I received zero helped. I was maybe only one out of five customers in the store when there was on the average looked like 10 Nike employees all hanging out talking to one another laughing giggling touching kissing.",20 February 2019,US
Marshay Kellum,"Nike.com is the most reliable website to shop on for athletes, coaches, and people who like wearing comfortable sports wear. Nike.com is especially beneficial to last minute shoppers and people who don’t like waiting, like myself. I often shop last minute and have looked at other websites that have nice stuff that I’d want to buy, but their shipping was like two weeks wait which made me turn away. Also I have shopped on Macy’s to get some sports wear and their was a max amount of money I had to spend on items in order to get free shipping and I barely wanted to pay for what I had in my shopping cart. In comparison, Nike.com has free shipping for members and their shipping is two days to no more than a weeks’ wait. With all of the other websites I have shopped on like Macy’s, Sporting Goods, Footlocker, and Eastbay: when I finally signed up for Nike.com and shopped, I realized I found that I found my perfect match. I have always been the type of kid who sees something she likes and go buy it whenever I get the money so even when I came up with just $20 I’d go on Nike.com to buy me a T-shirt which I couldn’t do on Macy’s with their max spending rule. When christmas was coming up I knew I could rely on Nike.com to get my shipment in time to give gifts. Nike also sells baby clothing, so options are not limited to age or gender. All in all I believe Nike.com is the best place to shop for athletes and last minute shoppers. Nike is the best place for me.",20 February 2019,US
OM,"The WORST experience shopping online in my ENTIRE life.I would be certain this is a scam if it wasn't for the Nike domain being official. After almost 3 weeks on the phone with them, around 10 different orders that never arrived, more than 15 calls to customer support in which 'we will contact you after finding a solution to all this' but they NEVER do, more than 10h on the phone with them (yes, 10 hours. It's everything on my recent calls, dates, times, etc), and more than £2500 spent, I have no placed orders, no clothes, and of course no money. You are a f*ing big joke and a DISGRACE for the Nike brand.If you ever have to call customer service in the UK, just don't. But if you ever have to talk to Connor or Kelly, then you are really doomed. I've got them recorded lying again and again. LIARS. Nike, get your ** together.",17 February 2019,GB

Marinelo T.,"Nike! Please don't use DHL to handle all of your deliveries.This is my second time that DHL handled the delivery of my orders and I always have to reschedule the delivery. They don't give updates when it's already on transit or already at your home for delivery. The only update that I got from them is a text message stating that ""they tried to deliver the package but no one was home"".I was home between the time of delivery and didn't hear any ring on my bell or receive any updates.It is frustrating that I have to call DHL to ask for redelivery.  They just stated that the delivery person has more than 200 packages to deliver and they don't get paid to wait for the receiver to pick it up.I woke up early and cancel all of my morning appointment to wait for my package to arrive and I have to do it again the next day because they failed to deliver my package.

Mark Burban,"I'd give them 0 stars if i could. so i purchased a pair of sneaker on their online store & they shipped after a few days, advising me they'd arrive in about 7 days & supplied me with a tracking number. So i kept an eye on the tracking number & on the morning they were supposed to be delivered i stayed at home, because I was very keen on getting these new kicks. while waiting I check the tracking & see that there has been a 'failed delivery' & that the item is now at my local post office awaiting collection.. So the next day i head down to the post office & they search everywhere & can't find the parcel; nor do any of the tracking numbers nike supplied work. They advise me to contact the store to ask for help.So i email nike, multiple times & receive no reply.. Eventually i manage to connect to them by online chat & i'm told that the courier was unable to find my house & that the shoes have been sent back to Nike.. At no time did nike ever make an effort to contact me to let me know there was a problem with shipping.. nor did they bother replying to the multiple emails i sent them asking about my order? So i got a refund & i hope they don't muck that up as well. Nike just lost a customer of some 20 years.. truely awful customer service.",11 February 2019,AU
Thomas Stamper,So today while attempting to buy my son a birthday gift we go to the parkway place Mall in Huntsville Alabama find the shoes he likes and they don't have them in his size. Which is just a 14 not nothing crazy just a 14 that I think all Footlocker should stock on all of their shoes we asked the clerk to go get us 14 in six different kinds of Nikes and every time they could not retrieve the right size. So we go online and attempt to buy the same shoes online but we have the same problem you cannot select size 14 and add them to your cart so this seems like a scam forcing people to spend more money getting the other shoes that are comprable which are the Nike air vapormax Flyknit 2 which he doesn't like as well as the ones that he had picked out.just seems like a nice way for Nike to get $30 more out of somebody for shoes they really don't want when they should have a size 14 in any size shoe on their shelves at the store and online very displeased perhaps Adidas or New balance could accommodate a size 14 in any shoe that they sell.,10 February 2019,US
Lucia Ali,Decent quality stuff when I eventually get it.... DPD are atrocious-please stop using them Nike!!I’ve had to literally sprint after DPD vans stopping in front of my flat and then just driving off saying “we tried but you were out” on their mobile message service (good sprint training but not great when you’re not donning your fitness attire).

Эсен Тюкебаев,"I met Nike when I bought my brother's sneakers. This is a favorite brand of shoes. Let me think and I will try, and bought the shoes of this brand. Don't buy just was not possible. Such soft, light, covers the foot so quietly that it seems as if you don't go in them, and fly. Man is constantly in motion. Therefore, it is very important to pay attention to what we go. The lucky ones are those who can afford to choose shoes to taste, not paying attention to its cost, the rules of the dress code and fashion.Buying the first sneakers was memorable for me. Bought easily, found quickly, fell in love at first sight, served at the highest level, the price was satisfied, and as soon as I put them - I realized that this is what I was looking for. My first running shoes were NIKE",29 January 2019,KG

The representative put customer experience at the forefront. The issue was resolved quickly and without any issues.

Carrie Weinberg,"One of my pet peeves is when you order something online to make your life easier and you end up on the phone with them on and off for 2-3 weeks holding everybody's hand and trying to get them to do their job correctly. I ordered a pair of shoes from Nike. I got the item I ordered, but with someone else's receipt in the box. I had to call customer service to get my correct receipt and shipping label e-mailed to me so that I could return the shoes. The shipping label with the incorrect information they already sent me was pre-paid. The correct one they sent me was not, so I ended up paying $17 to ship the shoes back to Nike. They did not send me a confirmation that they received them or that a return was being processed, so I had to call them again. I asked if I could be reimbursed because I had to pay to return the shoes because of a mistake they had made. They said they would give me a discount on the next pair of shoes I ordered...even though I am obviously not eager to repeat this experience. It's not so much the amount of money, it's the principle. They made a mistake, then made ANOTHER mistake on top of it, and because I didn't have time to make yet another phone call to them asking them to send me the correct label, I had to pay for it and they are not willing to meet me halfway.",26 January 2019,US

EVERY order atleast 2 items sent back due to the quality of the material (bobbling when washed within 2 weeks) or just the items were constructed badly. Also ordered trainers, and returned them before i even got them, as UPS doesnt know how to ring when unsure of location, and i wasnt in the mood to sit in all day again because UPS dont do delivery estimated times. Nike your ONLY saving grace is the customer services. Very friendly and helpful. Oh and i needed to exchange one item due to shoddly put together by one of nikes obscure location factorys (no arm hole elastic, arms too long and main body cut dodgy), sent the thing back YOU had it a week and ended up having to call customer services who couldnt understand why it hadnt been sent.

JamesO,"We have had 2 deliveries from DPD in the last month and both of them were terrible. Delivery 1) ordered the new Apple watch from EE online who use DPD to deliver their parcels, on th day of delivery no one calls and rings the bell and the next thing we know a message has come through stating that they were unable to deliver our parcel. My partner calls DPD who said that they will get the depot to call. This was at about 1:30 p.m. at 5 p.m. she call DPD back and a different agent stated that the label on the package did not have the first line of the address on it so they could not deliver it. We asked why they didn't call the phone number that they have to confirm door number  they then stated that they don't do that and that they will not be able to deliver it again at all as the label is wrong. We called EE who arranged for my partner to pick this up from a pick up point the next day. No apology and no offer of compensation even though they were told that this was a birthday present.Deliver 2) my partners ordered shoes from Nike.com and deliver was through DPD. On the day of delivery notifications received saying that it is on its way and partners actively tracked it on her phone until it said that DPD were here, we waited for the bell to ring but nothing. 5 min later we received a notification stating that no one was home and a photo of our front door. We called DPDD customer service and spoke to Corey who allegedly tried to call the drover but could not get tgrouch and then we're told that there is nothing they can do. My partner then went on their app and arranged to collect from a pick up point AGAIN!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. NO RESPONSIBILITY TAKEN. AVOID THIS COMPANY!!

Ben Parker,"If I could give this a minus score then I would. I ordered my first pair of shoes recently from the Nike app and it looked great. When it arrived the shoe had a large pen mark on the front of a supposedly new suede brown shoe. It looked awful. So I tried to send it back and get a new pair. Next day I gave it to the collection people and sent it back. It arrived at Nike two days later (I had to find this out myself as I wasn’t even made aware). I waited several days for any sort of response and got nothing. Eventually I had to call them up and ask about it and the person told me that they were not even set for an exchange and will be refunded as soon as they were processed and would take 4-7 days. So after many days of them having them they chose to let them sit there. So I let it slide and waited a while longer. A week later and I was getting impatient. So I decided to ring them again for some sort of acknowledgement as I was left in the dark about everything that was happening. Turns out the person told me this time it will take 5-9 days now. This annoyed me even more as I went to be waiting almost 2 weeks for them to simply give me an email saying they were being at least looked at. If I was updated regularly about the process and how long it could take then I wouldn’t of minded so much. But this was just ridiculous. Then they had the audacity an hour after I called them for the second time about the shoes to START processing the shoes. They then sent me an email for the first time since they gave me the shoes 2 weeks from when I sent them back acknowledging me and the shoes. Then followed with an email two days later saying that they are refunding it. So much hassle and stress over nothing. I’m waiting on the money to be transferred to my account still even to when I’m writing this. Product was faulty, service was terrible and a waste of my time. I also got another email saying for me to give feedback and fill a survey for them... no. And then a further email offering 20% off next purchase. If I was getting something like socks for free as a token of being sorry then maybe but I am not giving you another penny. PLEASE MAY I STRESS!

Martha Alvarado,I did an exchange online at Nike.com & the lady checked that they had the item I wanted before placing the exchange order. I was told it would take about a week to be delivered & that all I needed was the order # to check the status. I called back a week later & got told 3 different things & hung up on twice because at the moment I couldn't verify the email address that placed the order. I had everything including the debit card that paid for the order & tracking receipt # from UPS. I basically got the runaround & in the end I know why. This exchange was done the beginning of Dec. & at the end of Dec. the day after they assured me that it would be shipped they cancelled my order because they no longer had the item in stock. Now I'm told not even corporate can help me out. All I can do is go to a store that has it in stock in another state or reorder from a store at a higher price then I originally paid. Go figure.

Neither did I ever receive a UPS note about order being missed nor was I contacted in any way to be informed about the same. I am travelling in 2 days and with all the other things, they are making me run around UPS stores. When I called them,the system didn't recognize the numbers I typed and was the most inefficient system ever. Also, after finally getting to a representative, I did not get information on which UPS store had my package and where should it be collected from. I was just given three numbers to call and ask for my package without the proper locations.

Called them and tried to place the order online.  They went through the process and got to the payment point and also had an error message.  They said it was because I was using a non-US card and gave me another number to call.  Called them - went through the same process only to get the same issue.  Several calls and hours later (overseas phone call) they finally just disconnected the line.  Tried again the next day by phone using a US bank debit card.  Same issue and said they couldn't understand the error message - that it had to be reviewed by their 'Elite Sales Team'.  They assured me they would hold onto the shoes in my cart until they could get back and resolve the issue.   More than 3 weeks later still no follow-up.  I call or chat online a couple of times a week to see if anyone can tell me if it is still being followed up and when they will reply.  Just tried again now.  Same answer ""Rest assured that it is being handled by our Elite Team that expertly handles this issue.""  They can't tell me when this might happen.  The shoes of course are no longer in stock so even if they could fix the problem I can't buy them.  There seems to be no way to talk to someone with more authority or able to really take action - when I ask for a supervisor I get put on hold for about 30 minutes then disconnected.  If anyone has a way to actually get to talk to someone who can deal with this please let me know.  I like the products but this level of service is truly horrendous.",07 December 2018,AE

Roy Brock,I bought a pair of Nike Reax tennis shoes. Hardly ever wear them. The shoe is so squeaky it sounds like you're playing an instrument. Then I called Nike. They said there's nothing they can do. What great customer service when you spend that much money on a product you expect to get some decent customer service and return the lady basically told me I'm screwed who wants to wear a super squeaky shoe I would recommend not buying them unless you like to hear a squeak every time you step,01 December 2018,US
Syed,"This review is exclusively for the Jordan brand of trainers, I’ve experienced issues in regards to the quality check of the Jordan branded trainers have purchased several pairs and on 3 occasions the trainers had some kind of damage I received another pair of Jordan retro 5 trainers yesterday and upon opening the package I noticed one of the trainers has slight damage at the back extremely dissatisfied that once again I have to go through the complaints process to get a exchange or a discount for the damage, Nike.com really does need to sort out it’s quality control of the Jordan trainers as I’m a collector of these trainers and I expect them to be in A1 condition",01 December 2018,GB
Amanda,"The shoes aren’t the issue, but I tried ordering a pair of converse via the Nike website and my payment would not process multiple times. Useless customer service reps tried blaming it on the debit card that I know has funds available and which I use regularly. I received an email asking how I felt about my experience with the customer service on the site, and explained my situation. I got a response back weeks later stating that “they do not accept credit cards from New Zealand at this time” I live in the states and my card is linked to a bank here so I think they should work in fixing whatever the issue is instead of blaming the problems on the customer. I ended up ordering the sneakers through another website and will never purchase anything directly from Nike in the future, especially seeing as I googled the error code I was originally receiving and am far from the only one who’s experienced this issue.",30 November 2018,US
Mark Rusc,"DO NOT BUY NIKE SNEAKERS FOR YOUR KIDSNike,  great company image but does not stand by their products. We purchased a pair of Nike Shoes for my 8 year old son in Sept 2018, by Nov 2018 one of the two sneakers were already falling apart.Having 3 young children we are used to having to buy new sneaks about every 8 months, but after 3 months that is unbelievable. Contacted Nike and basically received the run around and asked to visit their Customer Care team which is impossible to get a hold of.  Being a Disabled Vet we can not afford to run out and buy our kids new sneakers every 3 months. Unfortunately, even though I grew up loving Nike, we will start buying other brands that hold up.Disappointed Dad",29 November 2018,US
Cathy,"I bought my daughter Nike KD-10 basketball shoes in September 2018. After not even 10 practices the air pockets in her right shoe deflated. I was told by Nike to send shoes to Toronto to be inspected. As asked, this is what I did at a cost to me. I was told through a letter and email that the inspector did not feel it was an issue with their shoes and their warranty will not cover it. The shoes are brand new, I wish I could send a picture with this review. While doing more research, each sports store you go to talks about these issues with these specific make of shoes, in fact one actually shared that an entire teams shoes were sent back. Shame on you Nike for your extremely poor customer service.  My daughter reps your shoes (training & street style) and Nike clothing on a daily basis, but now has a story to tell about her recent experience with your product and customer service. Does Kevin Durant know how you treat customers who buy these shoes?",26 November 2018,CA

Assasson Worrior,Ordered a shoe and came with an inadequate quality looking like it was repackaged and shoe material was of low quality plus wrong size. Not expected from Nike but here we are. Tried to open a return request where my order was nowhere to be found on my account so I googled and found out that you have to type in your order reference number on their return request page which I did exactly as instructed but my order was not found. Tried calling and no one picked up and tried to start a chat session which takes 30 mins to start.,26 November 2018,GB
C Le,"I’ve spent a lot of money through Nike.com and they’ve never let me down so far. I’ve bought mostly footwear but also clothing and some accessories.Dispatch and delivery is quick and the courier company is one of the best as they give you a 1 hour time slot so you can run errands and make it back in time to receive the delivery.Every single thing I’ve received has always been packaged well and nothing has been damaged in transit.On the rare occasion I’ve had an issue it was with their hypercool baselayer tights that had the Nike Swoosh peel off on two separate items through no fault of my own. I spoke to a lovey guy through the online chat and explained my issue. He seemed to actually care, was very professional and personable and arranged for me to send the items back with the returns pack he sent to me and refunded me for the items plus something extra for my troubles. I just wanted a pair of tights that didn’t have the swoosh peel off but this was honestly the next best conclusion. I loved that by sending the tights back Nike’s relevant department could see what the issue was and resolve it for future products.Their app is extremely easy to use and I love their easy returns and great 30 days change of mind policy. It takes the stress and worry from buying online. Although I just wish their clothing was as durable and long lasting as their footwear.",24 November 2018,GB

LB,"Returned some trainers and courier tracking showed that Nike received these back in their warehouse on 14th Nov.  Hadn't had any confirmation from Nike so phoned a week later to chase up and was told that these hadn't even been scanned back in yet.  Nor was there any way of knowing when this would happen, and thus when the refund could be processed. This is completely contrary to the refunds policy shown on their website. The guy I spoke to did his best to help and I can't fault him but sounds like his hands were tied by their slow systems.Moreover, I was on hold for 10 mins on the 'returns & refunds' line; the phone finally rang but then just went dead, so I had to start the process all over again and choose another option. Wasted half an hour chasing this this morning only to be none the wiser.",21 November 2018,GB

Jessica,"I absolutely love Nike; the majority of my workout gear is from Nike and I only wear Pegasus or Winflo shoes for running and the gym. However, following my latest experience, I won't be using Nike again. I put in an order for a new pair of trainers, since I needed a pair with more cushioning. I waited in all day on the expected delivery date, only for them never to show. I then checked the tracking info - said that they had been cancelled. I was frankly really appalled that a massive vendor fails to let its customers know that their order has been cancelled; I had had no communication from their team, no explanation and I am a really loyal customer. I had to contact customer services which in itself is somewhat of an ordeal. They have no email address to send complaints to, so it is pretty sketchy because it means there is nothing in writing and you don't get a solid response from them. The lady who I ""chatted"" with online did not have the greatest customer service skills; it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to apologise for something which is actually pretty bad if they want to keep customers. She actually seemed pretty aggressive at times too,which only antagonised me further. The fact that there is no official complaints procedure is really bad because you don't know if anything is actually going to be done about the issue or if they're just going to continue the way they are. Basically, this combination of bad customer service both in terms of no communication regarding the status of my order and the lady who ""helped"" with my query has led me to the reluctant decision not to use Nike anymore. I have found GymShark to be very good with regards to clothing (and their dispatch rate is phenomenal), but will have to investigate adidas/new balance and so on to find a new set of trainers. Well done for losing a customer who has probably spent thousands of pounds with you.",12 November 2018,GB

Salvo,"So here is the thing, i love nike but i never buy a jordan and dont wanna pay a resell for jordan not because i cant buy it but i rather buy a designer shoe if the jordan that i want is too overpriced, so the moment i see the jordan 1 NRG ""not for resale"" i really like concept, i fell in love with the shoes, so i wake up early to queuing the countdown of the shoe, i log in to my account and waited, after the countdown has over i chose my size and click add to chart and guess what ? It answered with a pop up message called failed to fetch ! , i waited for a frickin 3 hour ! like what the F ! normally if somebody is already purchased and in the process of payment the pop up will said ""sorry other customer is already purchasing this pair and in the process of payment do not give up you can purchased it if the customer not paying within a minute"" Ok i think maybe it was because this time because of the hype the demand is high, but guess what the second attempt i try to click add to my chart it worked and NRG succesfully landed into my cart i fastly clik checkout, but the moment i click checkout, here comes the endless loop of loading ! And boom, i come back into the jordan 1 NRG not for resale Page ! Like, i dont know man if Nike website developer is so dumb enough that their website cant even differentiate between someone who truly buy to wear the shoes or some people who buy it using a bot to resell it for a hefty doubly mothastupid price ! It killed the concept purpose of the shoe itself ! Or i dont know maybe it because soo many of your employee that backdooring the shoe so that your loyal customer could not even buy some shoe that he really like by tempering your customer connection ? I checked through netLc that someone is try to temper ny connection and guess what it came from the same ip as your website ! Such a good employee you got there nike !",07 November 2018,ID
Sandy Todd,Never purchased from Nike.com! The person who stole my card did. I cancelled my card immediately. Hard to contact them because you have to have a sign on and password.Like I'm suppose to know the theif's sign on and password. Reported the incident to them and my bank 4 months later they gave my money back then month later took it again. I will never buy the brand NIKE ever again!

Get email 2 days later saying the order was split into 2 shipments.  1 package they can track. The other they don't know where it is.  They don't know which has the shoes and which has the socks.  They think 1 package will still be delivered.  Don't know when.  They won't give me a refund until they get their products back.  What the???!!! I don't know where your packages are.  Why should I wait until your packages are found before I get a refund?  NO order status updatesNO accountability.

She asked me to hold the line to see if a supervisor/Manager could do something for me.Again she apologised and said there is nothing that can be offered or done.So there you go Nike you have lost a customer!!Do you care?

Jessica,"- Incorrect parcel being delivered on Tuesday- DPD telling me nobody is in to sign for deliver (was two people in the house)- Parcel delivered Wednesday - Checked contents and sent back as had someone else's order.- Nike are unable to switch my parcel with the correct one. I have to wait for a refund and re order.- Re ordering I cant use the 25% discount (originally had this as a birthday email discount). Have to email Nike for them to refund the 25% cost- Give me next day delivery code (as compensation - which does not help me at all as my parcel was supposed to be with me on Tuesday) that does not work  - Send Nike new order number they can only offer the 25% discount and not next day free delivery. For some reason they cant get this sorted. Therefore parcel will be received almost a week late.I feel like the company has not helped or made the process any easier or even 'tried' to help me out over an initial error made by the company in the first place. Even after the initial switch of parcels everything since then has been hard work.

Jay Harvey,"Yes, NIKE is currently taking heat for a poor choice in their advertising campaign, but my complaint is about Nike Customer Service and Customer Relations which are inexcusably sub-par and unacceptable for a premium company.  Today, I called to get help with a $200 shoe only to experience a smokescreen of unenthusiastic, low level cust service. I had to ask for a supervisor. With much resistance, finally a helpful person (somewhat). Because I just spent $400 on two pair of Nike, I was annoyed at the difficulty and stonewalling from Nike. I decided to share my experience, so I called NIKE - Main Office asked for Cust. Relations, wasted 34 min in cue, and finally hung up in disgust with NIKE.  I created my own solution. Both pair will be returned this week. Done. NIke is simply not a company that cares about their customers satisfaction, just their money. Returning my $400+ purchase will make me feel better even though nothing will change at NIKE.  I have choices. Nike will never again be on a Christmas or Birthday list for anyone in my family.

There were so many amazing athletes that you could have chosen but you decided to go with the most non-patriotic person that you could find.  He is not even a good athlete.

I refuse to buy from you when there are so many other faces you could have used for your company.

Peter Pan,"Let’s see, Colin Kaepernick ‘sacrifices’ a LOT! Nike makes shoes that resulted in over 1,700 young black men being killed in 2015 by other young black men for some Air Jordans…. I do not see ANYTHING being done by Nike to prevent this. No advertising…nothing. Now Nike pays Colin lots of money for the Just Do It Campaign, which according to him is the violence against black men. Do you think that Nike should do something????“These shoes are important,” D.C. prosecutor Ella Gladman told Okun during her opening statements as she recounted details of the shooting from her witnesses. “These shoes are the reason James was killed.”Prosecutors said the teen witnesses saw James fight with the person who demanded his shoes then lost sight as James fled. They did not see the shooting, but arrived soon after, prosecutors said.“The witnesses saw the defendant after the shooting running away, holding the red sneakers in his hands,” Gladman said.From Sports Illustrated 1990: THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON A LONG TIME!There are deeper societal issues of violence and status involved. Looking back at Sports Illustrated’s famous 1990 cover story, “Your Sneakers or Your Life,” which focused on the murder of a 15-year-old boy over his Jordans and brought sneaker violence to national attention, it’s evident that the 17-year-old killer in that case didn’t do it just for the shoes. The victims of these crimes are disproportionately young, black men.Undoubtedly, however, sneakers continue to create opportunities for some problems to play out. Early on, the Sneakerheadz clip shows news footage from a mob scene of customers stampeding to get newly released Jordans, and stories of actual deaths are far from rare.What can be done about it? Twenty-five years after Sports Illustrated’s big story, there’s still no good answer.",04 September 2018,US

ΨψψΨ ΩωωΩ,"Hi. I have bought from the Nike website pair of shoes which came with small but noticeable defects. At 150 pounds a pair I would expect perfection from their side. I returned them after i send photos to their email adress with the hope that if I will buy another one will look like I would expect even though I had to wait one week for the money to be back in my account. They offered a discount and that is why I have decided to give them another chance. The second pair, a new type of defects worse like the first one . I have the feeling that no one is doing any kind of quality check. I had the thought that a fake replica of this shoes will look better than the original since some of them pass as genuine all the time. Very disappointed, not because of their service but because of the product. I have various Nike shoes bought from different retailers at much better prices, but I wanted to buy something new directly from them and to expect a nice experience and quality products. Not this time.Thank you Nike for this experience and because the only solution that offered me customer support was to buy it once, even if that meant paying over 400 pounds in just a few days and waiting a week for a refund for each transaction. Big dislike from me this time Nike.comI would like to have the option to add photos....like everyone  to be able to see how my orders looked.",21 August 2018,GB

Alex B,"Shocking service at Oxford Circus store.A quiet time and one member of staff was so rude when I asked where the women's trainers were.Despite their obvious distain at my interrupting their general chatting about 'shiz' I persevered and found the women's trainers.After being offered no help by the chav styled girl quite literally doing nothing and whose sole job it was at that time to help customers with trainers I just ordered a pair for my girlfriend - simple I thought.So I then watched whilst she took the confirmation of an order as a prompt to chat to her mates, catching up before she, as a side thought, found it within her to order my trainers. 5 mins passed and not even a 'they'll be out in a minute', just some chatting with her mates, who also seemed to also revel in not helping people, maybe inwas jaded at this point though.  Still, I didn't interrupt as she was having such an amazing time, so I gave up and walked out.  I quite literally hated the experience and left feeling like my custom was actually a hindrance to them.So that's it, done with Nike... congrats Oxford Street store for making me look at competitors ...that is the only gift I came out of there with! My summary of Nike would be that they are trying to trade as a premium brand, but in this day and age it's the whole experience that gives you that and they are falling way short..my advice, go to a high end retailer for better quality experience, or just buy online and cut out the horrible store.",11 June 2018,GB
Ryan Acosta,garbage....I won 2 pairs of shoes in the lottery only for both to get declined when I had funds available. Nike does not know how to make their loyal customers happy after disputing the transactions for 4 hrs I was even more disappointed! save your time and money and buy third party or better yet probably better off with Adidas they care asbout their customers!,09 June 2018,US

Nike haven't sent my parcel, have called Saturday, Monday & today - no one can tell me where my parcel is, when it will be sent or when it will arrive.Last conversation I was told someone will call me Thursday with an update, which will be over a week since I ordered, and 6 days after the trainers were meant to arrive.I have requested a refund, but that will take 5-7 working days and also can't be confirmed until Thursday.",05 June 2018,GB

Pankaj Rajan,"Ordered the new football pants off here and got it yesterday. The fit was perfect and their size guide and general tips are accurate. Customer service is really good. At all stages of the ordering and shipping, the customer service was helpful in sharing information that you can't see on the website (Tracking won't show till it is in your country). The only flip side is shipping to NZ is very arbitrary (3-12 days) and mine came in 10 days. Wish they could do it sooner considering that shipping is being paid for by the customer. Also, not much difference between Standard and Express in terms of shipping time but way more expensive. Overall, great experience, great product, accurate but slightly long shipping duration.",29 May 2018,NZ
Sheila Haynes,"I am very disappointed with Nike’s service. I initiated a return/replacement of some brand new soccer cleats on May 7th. We had only purchased them less than 2 weeks prior. I was originally told that I would need to send them back, and then someone would review the problem and either credit me for the shoes, or they would deny the return and send them back to me. Right now they are the only soccer cleats that fit my son so that was unacceptable. I reviewed Nike's return policy while talking to the person, and let them know we were well within the 30 return for any reason policy. One of the shoes was falling apart and I just wanted an exchange for the very same shoe. He realized he was mistaken and that I could return them for any reason. He sent me a return label and I mailed them through UPS the same day and expected a new pair to arrive soon. After about 11 days, I called Nike again because the shoes had not arrived. I learned from the representative that for some reason, Nike cancelled my return. I received no email or any communication about this. Nike received my defective shoes, and then just didn’t send me another pair, or issue a credit to my card.  Meanwhile, my son is playing in borrowed shoes that don’t really fit him. The representative I spoke to apologized and said that a pair would be sent out right away, and would arrive by either today, May 22nd, or tomorrow at the latest. He also offered me a 20% off coupon for my next Nike purchase, which I have not yet received. My son was hopeful that the cleats would arrive today, but now I received an email saying that they just shipped today. I am very disappointed that Nike didn’t do more to remedy the situation in a timely manner.  If I had not called, I would have been out a pair of soccer shoes, as well as $250.00. On 5/25 I again called Nike because although I received notice on 5/22 of shipment on next day air, the tracking info never advanced and even on 5/25 the tracking info said it would update when it moved.  I do not understand why it has been so difficult to get a pair of shoes from Nike. I spoke to a corporate person I was advanced to to try to get to the bottom of it. No one could tell me where my son’s shoes are. This is unacceptable. We paid $250 for defective shoes and then have to through all of this back and forth to have them replaced. My son is all about soccer, and he has  been without proper shoes since 5/07 and there is nowhere on Maui to buy soccer cleats so we are stuck. Again, the representative said a pair would ship  (5/25) out but wont arrive until the 29th. How is that next day air? I was told that a manager would reach out via email and send me a 20% off coupon. My son is sitting here crying because he has a game tonight and has to wear shoes that don’t fit him. Nike should be doing so much more to fix this. 80% off wouldn’t even be worth this hassle.I would never have bought $250 soccer cleats knowing that if they were defective, it would take at least 22 days to get a new pair (assuming they arrive on the 29th). Today is the 29th and I have received zero information from Nike regarding shipment or tracking so I am assuming they are not on their way.",29 May 2018,US

Rajnesh,I purchased Nike (DOWNSHIFTER 7) running shoes from Sports direct around 3-4 months back. I am using the same only to commute my office. They gone bad within same period and Store manager responded that they cann't guarantee any product even gone bad within 2 months. I am not sure about this kind of branded quality from Nike through sports direct.Thereafter i logged complaint with Nike customer care and they stated that you have send shoes to Netherland for our test on your postage expenses. I am living in Newbury UK. Thereafter only we can tell about the further procedure. There should be some nearby Nike store to have a look and make judgement. How can someone after feeling cheated further invest money in crap product to send across to Netherland from Newbury UK only for further investigation.It is highly disappointed....,24 May 2018,GB
jonineb,"Ordered a pair of custom Nikes at a work event. somehow the order was canceled by Nike after they emailed to confirm they had them ready to ship. Then when I tried to reinstate the order, they again canceled the order. I said ""just do it!"" they not only did not honor the original transaction and cost, but then charged.

Courier said it's either been delivered and the tracking didn't update or it's lost. Send proof of postage to Nike. At this point, it's the courier and Nike's problem not mine. Why haven't I been refunded yet? Refund the damn order, then chase the parcel with the courier. The parcels lost, so why I am constantly being told to wait for the senior team to investigate.

After contacting Nike I was told I’d need to post them to Amsterdam at my own cost. Hold on Nike your goods are of poor quality and you expect me to be out of pocket not very customer orientated are you. Then to try get me to sign up to your family club give yourselves a wobble your goods are over priced poor quality goods. Will stick with Adidas who’s clothes wash fantastic.,09 May 2018,GB
Francis Hys,"Great brand, produced a lot of great products especially the shoes, BUT the online shopping experience is HORRIBLE. All my purchases online via Credit Card are always cancelled for no reason even though transaction was a success. In the past, only 2 purchases via debit card was a success. Just a couple of days ago I made another 2 purchases via Debit Card, transaction online were success for 2 Air Jordan Shoes that cost around $100+ & $200+, was so happy because I managed to secure the Air Jordan 3 Retro re-Release after on queue online & I upon checking my bank account, I can clearly see my money were deducted from my account.However, to my shock when I checked back my orders status online; they were found to be cancelled for no reason & without any advance notification or email to me. Now I can no longer re-order the shoe because it is no longer available. To make It worst, my money was not refunded & when contacted to their support staff online, all they do is direct me to write email to another party, which then again reply my query & said that it has “AGAIN” been forwarded to another relevant party. Don't bother trying to talk to their chat support online, all they do is deflect the problem & ask you to email their ""Relevant Team"" for help....which never ever reply your email!The whole process was so frustrating and to this date I still haven’t receive any feedback from them. Not just that I don’t get the shoes I wanted and can’t get them anywhere anymore, but I am also $300+ short from my account that who knows when it will be return. So think carefully if you ever want to purchase anything online from NIKE, TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE AT ALL!",08 May 2018,AU

Then a few hours later I got an email saying that the amount had be fully refunded to me... I've not yet checked to see if it actually has (to be continued) --- but their system is stuck in the Stone Age, and was an over all really bad experience and waste of my time and money.

J J,"I buy online from Nike & regularly use the SNEAKRS app. Never had a problem with quality of product or delivery. Items are sent double boxed & are box fresh having never been tried on, because I know they fit true to my size, this is perfect for me.Nike, you only get 4 stars as the SNEAKRS app raffle system is flawed I’m afraid. I know you have been trying to tackle the bots & multi account resellers, but it just isn’t working. I’m not bitter because I have plenty of L’s because I realise if there was another way I still may lose! However, check eBay as soon as a raffle closes & you’ve notified winners & there’s a multitude of listings, sometimes 10x market value. It’s a free market economy, resellers are healthy to some extent driving hype for you & not everyone can win but maybe introduce a loyalty bonus for the raffle, whereby your loyal, regular buying public at least get a better chance for all the £’s or $’s they’ve spent to actually wear the kicks at original ticket price.",18 April 2018,GB

A few mins later they rep told me they then were out of stock the pair I want to exchange and can only get a refund. He said I can reorder again later....and provided me with a 15% off for them. I used a 30% for this order mind you and he basically said too bad. I then checked online to see if they have a similar pair and low and behold, the ones that was supposed to be out of stock is still in stock.

Kate,"I made an order with Nike on May 26. Ten days later I track shipping and see the item is still in transit. The shipping history shows my order went all across the country from Memphis to Honolulu and with several delays in between, stuck in different facilities. The customer service person could not tell me when the package would arrive, but encouraged me to buy the product again and get free (free?!) fast shipping whilst the original order is redirected back to Nike, as if this is in any way compensation. In this case a refund is not issued until original package is returned to Nike, and since I refused to spend more money with them I asked for an immediate refund. Again something that was refused. Nike has had my money for ten days and no product has been delivered to me. I received a standard apology but no solution that doesn’t require me to spend more money.  And I must now wait for the package to be returned to Nike before I am issued with a refund. Note: after ten days, my package is in Honolulu and I am in California.

Matthew P,"Nike has turned its sneaker releases into nothing shy of a disaster. From offering NYC only releases weekly to their atrocious online draw system, its evident that Nike can care less about getting shoes in the hands of their real customers instead of targeting re sellers. Scroll twitter and you can see people selling Nike accounts to trick the draw system, not only does Nike not even attempt to even filter these out, they seem to embrace it. It's been clear for a year now what is happening and they choose not to address it. But discriminating against smaller cities is the icing on the cake with Nike implying it only wants NYC to clearly own it's products. In reality everyone should have an equal and fair shot. I have been a very loyal customer for years, but now id rather walk barefoot then to support this brand who shows weekly they just do not care and to go as far as only target single cities constantly.",30 March 2018,US

Marlena Rose,"I call Nike.com because I had an issue with some converse I purchased. I order my converse to get blinged out for my wedding reception. When I ordered them they were sent directly to my sister who was getting them blinged as a gift. She checked to see if both shoes were in the box. Well comes to find out it was two different sizes and two of the same feet in the box. Well, we found that out after she blinged them out. And the lady did a great job. I’m so upset with Nike called them and they could not take them back because they were altered. So I had to purchase another pair. I feel like it was their fault they sent the wrong size and two right feet.  I shouldn't have had to purchase another pair they should have given me another pair or send me the correct size and the right foot.  All that money Nike makes I think they could have handled this situation better.  Offer a free pair and help pay for my blinged out services.",02 March 2018,US

Kate Marshall,The absolute worst customer service experience I have ever dealt with in my entire history of purchasing items online.  My children received gifts from relatives for Christmas totaling over $500 and simply needed different sizes in the sneakers.  Confirmed with a representative Exchange Policy and stressed the importance of EXHANGING vs. refunding due to purchases being made with Visa Gift Cards that were disregarded after funds were used.  After initial request to exchange and items were sent back to facility I called customer service and confirmed yet again the request to EXCHANGE and was reassured that items would be exchanged.  It took over a week to be informed that items were refunded to the gift cards that no longer exist and there was no way to exchange the items with refund already being issued.  I am now left with two children who are heartbroken about their Christmas gifts and a nightmare of a mess to sort through trying to tract down contact information for the Visa gift cards.

Alice Burns,"I have never bought anything from Nike online but as far as my experience in store goes I’ve always been very happy with the quality of Nike products. The friendly and approachable members of staff also add to my positive experiences with this company, especially in my local Liverpool branch. I’ve got a range of their training leggings which are the best fit out of many of the brands that I’ve tried, with thick fabric that washes well and stays looking good for a long time- in spite of frequent wear.  I’ve also had my Nike trainers for about five years and they’re still very comfortable and look relatively new despite again being frequently worn.  Just buy things in store rather than relying on line to avoid potential disappointment with online customer services.",05 January 2018,GB
Matt,"I started calling Nike about 6 months ago (June 2017), it was one number after another and of course everyone I spoke with said they were sorry for the inconvenience I was experiencing... On October 31, 2017 (after four months of attempting to report the separation of my ALL STAR - Converse soles from the rubber trim), I reached Leslie who took all my information and sent it to ""the right department"".  Eventually a ""Greg"" called.  After they claimed not to have any of the colour choices I asked for - including the colour of the defective shoes of course) Greg was prepared to replace mine with another style.  I asked for a few days to see them at a store before making my decision and he accepted.Within the week I called back to confirm the pair I wanted but received no reply yet again.  Several weeks later some guy named ""Kev"" called to say ""Long story short, Greg is no longer with us"".  I found this Kev guy quite offensive as he denigrated the previous employees work ethic while telling me he would not honour the previous employees promise to replace the shoes with another style.  He also claimed the exact replacements for my defective shoes had been shipped ""as we speak"" - about three weeks ago.  I have not received a confirmation of them being shipped and no shipping confirmation from the shipping company either.Not happy at all with the way Nike/Converse ""services"" their clients.I wont be buying Nike or Converse products again as a result.",04 January 2018,CA

They told me to use it and they would not cancel.  This is VERY POOR customer service.

This is really not my problem. In fact I spent hours on the phone and chat to Nike and DPD yesterday and today to resolve this and I can honestly say it’s been the worst customer service I have ever encountered.I made the order online with the confidence I would get my order in time and very smoothly, afterall it’s Nike right. I could have gone through JD Sports or alternative websites/stores. Nike.com over promised and under delivered here. No compensation yet to the effortless hours I spent on this, the stresss caused and the birthday gift planned for these trainers I paid for which is a massive disappointment as the birthday is now gone so it’s ruined.Nike.com checked stock today for their Kings Cross store and advised to go in as they have stock, I went there and unfortunatly they had a completely different colour so it wasn’t the same product. Really frustrating that Nike.com don’t take responsibility when they have messed up massivly here and compeltely ruined my experience.Not pleased at all and I wouldn’t recommend to shop here now.",05 December 2017,GB

They sent me multiples in an attempt to correct their error and still no good. I was told to wait for 24hrs, then 48hrs and now they’re telling me the wait should be 2-4days. Really? That’s how they accommodate my concern, by just telling me to wait. It’s just a $75 gift card and they can’t resolve it.

A Rival,"I purchased the Nike Magista cleat for my son.  This wasn't the first time we had bought that style or a Nike cleat.  Always in the past they would last for about a year.  This time the cleat lasted less than 2 months when the top of the shoe started to pull away from the sole.  I filed a complaint with Nike and sent it in for a review.  I received an email back stating that the damage was due to ""normal wear and tear""  not a manufacturing flaw, therefore they would not issue a voucher for a new pair, nor replace our existing pair. There was no visible wear or tear anywhere on the shoe, just the sole pulling away from about 1/3 of the top of the shoe.  When I called, it was just the scripted response over and over from the representative on the phone about wear and tear.

After researching tracking info and email confirmations, I discovered that Nike’s shipping department screwed up.  The tracking #’s emailed to me did not match the shipping cartons received.Nike customer service has confirmed the missing shipment but I have been advised that it will take 1-3 days for investigation (UPS trace) and up to 15 days for resolution.  15 days really??  They already took my money but will take 15 days to come back with a resolution? I am very unsatisfied with Nike’s e-commerce as they can’t ship a 3 line order correctly and the customer service policy backing it up requires half a month.  I thought a company of Nike’s stature would be more professional.-- Update 10/18The missing box got re-routed and delivered 4 days later.  And, Nike sent replacement shoes at their cost.

Tyrell Turner,"My family and I have been a strong supporter of Nike and have been loyal customers for a very long time! We have a beach house in Newport, Oregon so we usually stop at the Nike stores several times a year. My brother received a $25.00 dollar MVP promo for spending a certain amount of money on his school clothes. My family planned on going to a Nike store before the promo ended but my grandma's health has become very bad. She is currently in the hospital fighting to gain her strength back and has been sad because she cannot leave the hospital and does not like being alone. We have also been busy trying to clean the house and set up a room for my grandma so she does not have to go to a nursing home.I explained to my brother that I would call and see if they could honor his promo somehow and make an exception due to the current circumstances I contacted several Nike Supervisors and representatives asking if we could use his promo online/ do a order over the phone/ or even get a gift card sent to are address because we live hours away from the closest Nike store and the doctor hinted she may not live that much longer so didn't want to take the chance of leaving and something happening. (Not like we were going to leave my grandmas bedside anyway!) I contacted one Nike source and asked the employee politely to be able to speak to a manager. He returned after a long wait and said, ""The manager said all we could do is 20%."" (A code that anybody could get online to use toward a purchase and was not equivalent to the promo my brother had got for spending all his money on Nike merchandise.) My brother was upset and didn't understand why they couldn't honor his promo for a hoodie that was in their store and also was online. I was appalled and disrespected that a supervisor couldn't take a minute or two out of their time to come speak to me after I was waiting over the phone for a very long time. I am truly disgusted with Nike and the customer service. I am frustrated that a Billion dollar company and one that my family has supported for a long time could be so petty over $25.00 that a kid wanted to use toward a school Jordan hoodie for winter. I guess my family and I will have to look into a manufacture on the rise like Adidas since our loyalty/families health/ and our hard-earned money means nothing.",24 September 2017,US

The Nike logo started to detach itself.I reported this to Nike and they said they need to inspect them.As a result you then have to send them to Holland, at your own cost.If they deem that it is a quality isse, then they will refund on an e-voucher plus up to £20 for postage.All is great you think...... Read on.1. the postage is refunded as a e-voucher too, so you have to spend this with Nike, WHY?2. Since I bought the trainers as a deal in New York, Buy one Get one Half price. Nike will only give you back the discounted price if they deem it is a quality issue. If you do a conversion from Dollars to GBP, the e-voucher is worth £20. Nike do not have Tanjun Trainers for boys at this price online or anywhere else, so now you are forced to spend more. Hence why they give you the postage back as an e-voucher.3. When you email the online Customer service, they will just spout a pre-rehursed company script and policy at you.4. I asked to escalate this to senior mgt, only to be told, they dont speak to customers.I will never return to Nike, as this has just been appauling, their advisors have no common sense they read a script and Nike just want to line their own pockets.Nike,,,, you need to change your advertising slogan from ""Just Do it"",,,,, to "" Go Do One""",19 September 2017,GB

It's not just that the product is defective, more importantly, Nike NZ does not have a phone number and they do not respond to emails- we have posted the shoes to them nearly a month ago and no response- absolutely terrible service and not sure we will even get our shoes back. Contacted Nike.com and told there is nothing they can do re; Nike NZ- obviously not interested in protecting their brand worldwide either",18 September 2017,NZ

Toni Cotuleo,"The ONLY reason I gave it one star is because I HAD to.I have been a Nike customer all my life now my kids are.I had purchased my son a pair of Nike Roche. However, the size I purchase was wrong. I need to return them for an even exchange just in size 10.51. We can not walk into the store we are made to wait outside for 30 minutes while the employee allows people HE KNEW to walk in!2. I find the ONLY pair of 10.5 Roche I tried to look inside all over sneaker for size could not find one.3. I asked employees do I need to stand on this line that was WRAPPED AROUND the STORE because I have an EVEN exchange?? YES I need to stand on the line!4. Employees are walking around with hand held devices helping customers but could NOT help me for my EVEN exchange!! 5. I had to stand on line for 55 MINUTES!! For my simple even exchange!6. I FINALLY get up to counter ask the girl to check the size, and guess what??? The box said 10.5 but INSIDE the box was a 10.5 & 9 !! Two different sizes! 7. They looked for the match that took another 25 MINUTES!!!!8. I asked for a manager and he/she NEVER appeared!!!!So... for my EVEN exchange I was standing on line OUTSIDE...then INSIDE... then again to find the CORRECT size!!!! I am VERY unhappy as I am disabled with two Total Knee Replacements and I can NOT stand for very long!!!

They use a courier company named Aramex.  Aramex has had my parcel for over 3 weeks now and they still have not cleared it for customs duty.  Contacted Nike about the matter and they simply sent me an email to call Aramex and deal with the matter on my own as if I had entered into the transaction with Aramex. Wish they had handled the issue better and actually follow up to find our if parcels have been delivered within the stipulated delivery dates they send.

Peter Gusta,"We visited the Nike Premium Outlet store (Company owned) in Clinton CT on Sunday August 27th.  Despite the crowds ( you would have thought they were giving away footwear for free) we were able to select a pair of sneakers and a backpack.  There was a minimum of 50 people in line.  Staff was actually telling people that the checkout wait was ""likely an hour or more"".  No complaint that the store was this successful.  We were unable to complete our transaction due to time constraints, we waited 15 minutes and did not move.  We took pictures of the items we wanted and called the next day to get them shipped.  They are not available on the NIKE website, so we called the store.  The manager ""Steve"" indicated he had ""NO WAY"" to accept a payment.  So they could not ship the products. A perfect example of why brick and mortar stores are losing to AMAZON.  Amazon can find a way to accept payments and ship products so you have it the next day.  If Steve thinks he has a long term job at NIKE, he better hope Nike can survive against AMAZON, certainly this NIKE store will not with the current mentality, or is this the corporate mentality?",28 August 2017,US

Tracking my package online I saw where it was delivered and signed for by an unrecognizable name. Contacted the courier only to be told that Nike labelled my package incorrectly.

I returned with the prepaid sticker and got reimbursed within 3 days. One star off, as the website does not clearly state that clothes (at least golf clothes) are sold in US sizes, not UK, so a wasted delivery. And staff on the phone were not aware of this, so was advised it was a mistake. But now that I know, I will continue to get my golf gear with Nike online.",26 July 2017,GB

Andrea,"I wrote a review about the Nike air max 2017 on their website. It’s almost been a week and they still haven’t published it…I guess cause they don’t want to so I put it on here:I tested these at home, walked around for about 10-15 minutes and it already started hurting my ankle…I tried them on in the store so I was shocked how uncomfortable they were when walking more than a few metres! I returned to the Nike shop I purchased from and expected them to process the card refund in store immediately like other places do but no I had to write down my bank details on a piece of paper….seriously?! Then they sent it to some centre to process and it took 11 days to get my money back! After about a week I contacted Nike to ask what is taking so long and had to honour to exchange emails with Kevin who could probably win the world’s worst customer service employee award….So thanks to this and the incredibly slow refund process I will never purchase from Nike again.",19 July 2017,NL

This is where the fun starts, because I purchased the goods with paypal no order number was created.

It appears that their customer service and returns service are very poor according to other reviews.My advice is don't purchase anything without creating an account so that you have an order number if goods are to be returned.",05 July 2017,GB
Jack,"Do not buy Nike golf equipment! I purchased a pair of their golf shoes from a pro shop when I was on a golf holiday in the UK. These have fallen apart after a few weeks, and any other company would bend over backwards judging buy the problem to refund or send another pair. Not Nike! It is no longer their problem I was told by one of their useful representatives, as they have given that problem to the shops that sell them. Now that is really useful if you buy the shoes locally, but why shouldn't you be able to buy their equipment when you are away from where you live. Why should I have to travel nearly 250 miles to return a pair of £100 shoes that I never expected would break?I have already tried and given up with their customer service team, when you ask to speak to the MD they are unavailable, you are sent in the direction of an 'assistant coach'. Which are about as helpful as the original customer service...When I purchased the shoes I didn't think I would need to keep the receipt handy, as after all you would expect quality from Nike equipment right?The fact that they won't offer some help to a loyal customer in this scenario amazes me, and they won't even let you speak to anyone other than the 'assistant coach'.As previously mentioned, I was completely shut out by their customer service and given no alternative but to not play golf until I can afford another pair! Thanks Nike!",05 July 2017,GB

Anysa,"I purchased a pair on Nike Hightops online using Perkbox voucher for part of the payment. The shoes I received are defected. I wore them one day and got cuts behind my left ankle and got home bleeding. Hence I called for an exchange as I like the shoe and the size is correct. Instead of simply exchanging I was told I have to return them, get my money back, wait for the voucher to be processed again, and then purchase the shoes again. Having a nike lab across the street from where I live I don't see why the new pair can't be sent to them (as it was an option to collect from them when purchasing the shoes) and have the exchange there. Hopefully someone will look into their exchange due to defected item policy soon. I was not given any hassle free options even though Nike was responsible for selling a faulty shoe.",30 June 2017,GB

He promised to check it out for me and did it as well. He wrote back to inform me that it was a glitch and things are back to normal now.Before writing my review, I managed to glance through what others have wrote.

Nora Burns,"Look, I'm not one to complain....I have been a fan of Nike since I was young, but my experience ordering online with them recently went to crap very quickly. I ordered a hoodie that I have wanted for a year or two, and just haven't had the guts to spend $60 on it. The package came before the UPS tracking could catch up to it, so that was great...until I realized it was in the wrong color (human error, no big deal, free exchanges too). So I called, guy was super nice, corrected everything - but forgot to send me my return label, and said that I needed to pay an extra $60 to get the new one immediately without having to wait for the old one to return (which I will note he said can take ""4 to 6 weeks"". I decided to wait for my old one to be returned because I didn't want to have a hold of $60 on my account. So I had to call again to get a return label, lady sent it to me and out the package went to get a new one. So I called earlier this week asking what was going on since none of my orders were showing up on the website, and asked if they got my package, etc. The women was very understanding ( I wish I remembered her name - seriously should be promoted), and told me that the man should have just sent me the new one immediately and not charge me an extra $60 because of the fact that it was a human error in the warehouse. So expedited the shipping and it was supposed to get here today (Friday June 16th). Well after a week of this thing being ""preparing to be shipped"" I called and responded to a rep who emailed me because I am, at this point, not having it. Because I emailed the rep, he cancelled my order, little did I know he was going to reorder it because the tracking was messed up, but I called regardless and was asking what the heck happened. The women ensured that it was reordered and it would get to me by Monday (overnight shipping was supposed to happen...I wish this was all noticed on Thursday by my ""case manager"")  I have never had such a difficult online ordering experience and I just recommend everyone goes in store because this was absolutely ridiculous. Pray that I get this sweatshirt on Monday, because I desperately want it.",16 June 2017,US

I ordered a pair of Jordan 11's low the white and blue ones they were to big for me so I exchanged them for a 9.5 . But before exchanging them I called nike asking them if I exchange for a different size is it guaranteed for my shoes they said yes . And to remind y'all I called them 4 times asking them about my shoes they all said I will get my shoes and that ups has a delay .. well they ALL LIED TO ME !!!!! It's now a month after my purchase and I still haven't got my shoes or my dam money back !!! This is how you guys treat a nike plus member since 2015 ?? You guys should of never told me from the start that I was able to get my shoes when I return them ! I called before returning and then 4 days after the return and then I called back 3 more times during that month ! Now here it is may 4 th and the lady said they been sold out for a while now but yet the people you hired at nike told me 4 times ! Not once not twice but four times !!! That I am 100% guarantee my shoes . You guys really did me wrong in this situation I got my email confirmation saying my size is ready they even told me that it's boxed up and ready for shipment they are just waiting on ups to ship BUT IT WAS ALL LIES !!!!!  just because of this experience I will never be shopping at nike any more !!!

Cathy,"I have always liked Nike products but just had an interaction on the phone with a rep who had a real attitude; insisted on arguing with me and pointing out that what I was saying was incorrect. I had always had such prompt service and pleasant interactions before so was shocked at the rudeness of this rep. I had ordered shoes that needed to be exchanged for a larger size and although 2+ weeks have passed since Nike received the returned shoes, I have not received notification that the replacement shoes have been shipped. The rude rep tells me as soon as UPS picks the shoes up from the warehouse they will be sent and I will be notified. UPS comes to my house in the middle of nowhere nearly every day but they don't go to the Nike warehouse for over 2 weeks??? I'm not buying that explanation.

She was so helpful and explained (unlike other stores) that although they didn't have children sizes my daughter would most likely fit a women's size 6 - which she did.  She then explained a promotion that was going on and with the 20 % discount for buying two items we ended up getting a Nike top for the original  price of the shoes.  She didn't rush my daughter and explained to her the support the shoes offered etc.  Fantastic customer service.  Will go straight there next time she needs new shoes.,25 April 2017,AU

And when I asked to speak to his supervisor, he put me on hold for more than ten minutes and still said no supervisor was available to come to the phone.I never knew the big company like Nike operates worse than local mom and pop store. Shame !!!",18 April 2017,US
Felix,Im shocked that the biggest size they carry for the Tar Heel championship t-shirt is a 2X. I callec customer service to see if i could get a bigger size. They said no.

Belle Bae,"You probably won't bother this review but I'm still gonna write this. I like the design of Nike's t-shirts and sport shoes. It is comfy and has good quality. However, that swoosh logo ruined everything. I believe your product looks nicer without that logo blocking it. I understand that the logo meant a lot to Nike. It represents Nike itself, but you could have move it to the back of the shoe or underneath the shoe. As for shirt, you could have design it on the inside or on the sleeve cuff. I'm not buying the product to help Nike promote its brand. I really like that ""Just Do It"" t-shirt but that swoosh logo always present. It's like ""Hey, everyone. I'm wearing a Nike t-shirt. Nike scare you can't tell it is Nike's so they made a big s swoosh logo on it. I know it looks ugly but Nike had to make sure you know it's from Nike"". Come on Nike. Imagine every t-shirt in this world has some unknown brand's logo on it. Imagine when you watch Captain America and Steven Rogers' t-shirt has a big s swoosh logo on it.",11 April 2017,MY

Evelyn Yoshimura,I am beyond angry. I am livid. Nike has zero customer service. They have absolutely no clue as to how to handle stupid things they have done. My shoes are falling apart and they keep telling me to call these numbers and whatever but no one answers the phone when I call the numbers or they hang up. This is absolutely ridiculous. Safe to say I will be telling everybody about this unless something is done immediately.,02 April 2017,US
Bri Lambert,"Store #0166 in Washington, PA is awful. All of the workers are complete and total jerks and the managers are no different. Walking into this store is almost like reliving high school with how petty these members are. I shouldn't walk into the store and hear these ""team members"" talking badly about another employee and using choice words that I cannot put in this review. As a consumer it made me very uncomfortable and it's totally unprofessional. This is the first time I've had an experience like this. ""Assistant manager"" Janet was just the same. If I was Nike I would be ASHAMED of their workers. I will never shop there again.",01 April 2017,US

Scott Shattuck,"We wanted to use Converse in our wedding. My fiancée and I agreed to pay for the tuxedos and bridesmaids dresses and they purchase their own shoes. A few people got theirs ordered and with-in a few weeks they discontinued the color the last 2 people needed to order. After countless hours and attempts by myself (groom) and the maid of honor to talk with customer service and find the proper shoe and color they were useless. They just kept pointing us in a different direction with the color that was ""closest"" to what we needed. So you're a multi-billion dollar company and you can't make 2 more pairs of shoes?! We've since had to order something different that was the ""closest"" to what we already got, which happens to be no where near what we need. Thanks for ruining our wedding Nike!",22 March 2017,US

Tried to be put through to complaints told they didn't have a complaints department.  Told they didn't have manager or supervisor either.

Only returns then you get your money back then order again. Ok but will you have those shoe in stock by the time it comes back to you and so on I've asked. Yes sure loads of them in stock.So i send them back and call Nike again a week later. They didn't get my parcel so no refund and they size i wanted is no longer available locally only 200 miles away.How can a company this big does not have exchange service? I'm shocked and so decided no to bother with Nike again.,24 January 2017,GB

Well, i believed that it would. Under 2-3 weeks the status showed that the built has completed and just waiting to be shipped. A customer's service assured that the item would be shipped right away maybe earlier than christmas eve. I waited and waited until dec 22 still nothing happens. i checked with their customers service again and was informed that something came up with their courier so the shipment could only reach me on the 29th of dec. i decided to cancel my order and was told that it would take about 7-10 working days for it to be processed. Guess what, no email update was given regarding my refund. I feel like i've been scammed or robbed. For those of you who's planning to buy nike online, please think about it and consider buying in stores if possible. Their service is quite lousy and would definitely disappoint you.

Everything seemed okay, no price change at all - yet.. On the page were you accept the terms (the last click before completing the order) the prices changed. It said that the prices were before discount, i thought well okay that seems true. But then I noticed that my wife's sneakers price didn't change. I called Nike support and they said that there was an error. The sneakers were not on discount so they changed the prices while I was checking out. They were sorry, and that was it. What a baaaaaad service. The worst thing is they still haven't changed the price. Please dear friend, do not buy online. Not trustworthy and they may rip you off.

Michelle M,"Do not order from nike.com. they do not have the best deals on their shoes and it seems like no one on their live chat has any idea what they are talking about. First off they only give you 30 minutes to make any changes or cancel your order. By the time you realize you made a mistake the 30 minutes is up and there is nothing you can do personally. So I have ro live chat customer service where I Talked to one person who said they put in a request to cancel my order. I wake up the next mornimg talk to someone else who said the request was never put through. So I ask them to cancel the order which they said they did but there is still a chance the warehouse wont see it and ship them anyway. I livechat again 30 minutes later to see if this time the cancellation was put through. The person behind the screen says yes it was and the same stuff about the warehouse. Then later on in the day just to make triple sure that the request to cancel the order was put through I talked to someone else who said that the shoes would be shipped whether i ask them to cancel them or not! Despite them not even being shipped yet, which the person said nike prides themselves on shipping fast. I have to wait over a week for them to be shipped, return them, and wait  for them to receive them before I can  get any refund. Then thia person continues to try and annoy me and get a reaction out of me. What is the point?! Not only does this not make any sense but it sounds complicated for not only myself but for the nike company as well. How could a well known company like Nike have such a crappy online service. And it doesmt help that they bought converse who actually had a food shipping service?! I should have way more time then 30 minutes to cancel an order. You would think it is up until it gets shipped. And what was the point of even saying they would request to cancel it if they actually couldnt! Why not just tell the truth !",28 December 2016,US
Shirley Montgomery,"I  come to Nike frequently mostly for my kids but today I came in for myself and I saw KJ at the fitting room she is normally their when I bring my kids. She was friendly as always and even remembered my name, well as I was trying on clothes I heard a male speaking with KJ I assumed he was manament as to how the conversation was going. Now what bothered me was that he was having a conversation with her like that in a area where customers are and how he was talking to her. As I was listening i got bothered when He told her he felt if she didn't get the position she may go off or punch him (why would he say that) and asked her what would she do if she didn't get it her response was genuine she told him she would go for something else that she was bothered not because of that but because she kept getting put off, mind you I'm still in the fitting room then he goes on to tell her that he doesn't have to open a position and he is getting Irritated. Then he further goes on to  tell her how he fought for her to stay and other managers will see she is mad. She again told him she was not mad she was frustrated because she kept getting different answers. I was I'm disbelief he basically told her her job and a future position was in his hands. I waited until I no longer heard him,so I came on out and fighting back tears in her eyes she still asked me how did that fit and if I needed anything. I was extremely upset for her and I said no I'm ok and she told me to have a Happy Holiday. I came home and this was still on my heart so I thought you should know. I'm not sure if she felt stereotyped but I felt it for her. So can you please tell her thank you from me and my family for always helping us. She goes above and beyond and does a great job. Thanks KJ",21 December 2016,US

Tim Keough,"Ordered a limited edition Tom Brady Color rush jersey almost a month ago (9/23). One day before my estimated delivery date of 9/30 (i.e.: 9/29) they sent me an email saying it was delayed but the new ship date would be 10/7 or earlier. Yesterday (10/19) they sent me an email saying that unfortunately my item is ""unavailable"". As you would expect with a limited edition, this shirt is now not available anywhere so their incompetance cost me the opportunity to get this. Period. Beyond disappointed. When I called to see what they could do to compensate, it took more than half an hour of my time only to find out they had no comparable product, but if for whatever reason i still wanted to do business with them they would offer me a 10% discount. Absolutely a terrible way to conduct business and I'm sure this happened to others too. I won't be ordering from them again and would recommend to others not to trust the brand to deliver on it's promises. Oh, and they still haven't credited back the credit card I used which you think would be a priority given their complete ineptitude.",20 October 2016,US

Tim Purcell,"Ordered a NFL Football Jersey on September 20th through their website and was provided with a Delivery Date of September 27th (today). On the 25th, I check the order status and it still says Preparing to Ship.   Since that is only 2 days before the delivery date, I think it is a bit odd and contact them via the chat function on the website.  The Customer Service Representative, ""Mike"", basically reads back the status I am already seeing online and tells me to rest assured that the item will arrive as promised.  I found that rather unlikely and asked if it was being sent same day since it was Sunday night and the order was due Tuesday.  I also asked where my order was actually physically located at the time.  I was told, it is in the warehouse and don't worry, I'll get it. I asked where the warehouse was and ""Mike"" told me that it was a secure location and he couldn't share that information.  Really???!!!  I don't know about you but when I order anything online I always get the sending location as well as every stop on the way to my home when I check order tracking.  Clearly a lie and clearly I am being not being provided with any information of value about my order.  Fast forward to the day it is due, the 27th, today.  It is 9:00 PM and nothing has arrived.  I check the website.  The status is still preparing to ship, of course.  I figure I'll try my luck with the telephone customer service this time.  I spoke with a very nice young lady who was still unable to give me any information about the status of my order or when I could expect it to ship.  She did do a search of their retail stores and found two locations that should have the item in stock and she said they should be able to ship it to me.  I call the first location and they were out of my size.  I called the second location, the Nike Store in Las Vegas and a man answers the phone and says they don't take phone orders.  Since I just heard ""Follow up on your Phone Order"" as one of the menu options, I question him on it and he tells me it is a new national policy for all stores that went into affect last week.  Since he says he can't help me, I hang up.  I call back nike.com's Telephone Customer Service and once again speak to a nice young woman, I think her name was Janelle.  I ask her if there is a national policy that stores don't take phone orders and, if they don't, why isn't the Customer Service Center aware?  She speaks to the manager on duty and, apparently, there is no such policy.  This person in the Las Vegas store apparently just didn't feel like doing his job and lied to me as well.  She was very apologetic but  there was nothing they could do to help me.  I ended up just cancelling the order....which was a birthday present...a special, specifically asked for one.  So, this is the first and almost certainly the last time I will deal with the nike.com site.  Their products are good but apparently their retail business both online and physically, is very poor.",28 September 2016,US

Tsany Nickolov,"Dear Sirs,I am a fan of Nike running products and for a long years I have used and will continue to use very cushioning and anatomic Nike running shoes. But soon I have bad experience with your WildHorse trail model and I want you to improve your products to avoid this in the future for me  :) and for other runners, buying your products for outdoor running activities.Now I can say:Nike promote trail running models (I have problems with Wildhorse trail) which are dangerous when running downhill and outside of the road or tracks.Backside of the outsole is not properly designed and the result is - you are  in danger when running downhill on steep muddy surfaces. It is not only words - I have injured when running in the forest due to this poor outsole design.I could give an idea to Nike Designers about the perfect trail outsole design. Sirs, please see the outsole of VJ Sport Bold 7 Orienteering shoes. It is for my opinion the best outsole grid which is very safe for any outdoor, and for any not flat directions, and for any conditions surfaces.Thank you!With My Best Wishes,Tsany.",04 August 2016,BG

Felicia,"I finally called Nike for help and this is what i get.....S.O.L.As per Nike customer service.mfg date located inside of shoes older than two years will not be covered by Nike. Even if you recently purchased it from one of their retailers, it will not matter.I purchased nike mercurials for men paid over 200$ for it. It was used for two months and one of the cleat broke while playing on grass. I had to buy another pair urgently and totally forgot to call nike to take care of the broken cleat issue. I actually replaced it with the sock style green hypervenom phantoms for over $340 but this time kept the receipt to help fight my case.My point is. The nike soccer shoes are not cheap and i am not happy with nike not even willing to acknowledge the defect because it is outside of their company policies. It is ridiculous and shameful for a big brand like Nike to have their supervisors advise nike customers ""well if you want to return it you can but nothing will come from it"" Basically he is saying the inspection will not start even if i returned it to nike because of the mfg date."" Nike customer service rep and supervisor said sorry we cant inspect it for defects due to the mfg date and it doesnt matter when it was  purchased.Nike said its okay because we can offer 20% off your next Nike online purchase. What is 20% off going to do for me when its clearly a defect and i spent much more on purchasing  soccer shoes.  In fact i just bought a another pair of new soccer shoes phantoms this weekend..i spent over $300 and kept the receipt. I thought nike will assist with my issue hence the reason why i continued to purchase nike soccer cleats. I checked the tag today and mfg dec 2015. I already lost 5 months before outting it on the grass. Can you not cover the warranty from point of sale from either to the retailer or the consumer?To avoid the new cleats from breaking, should it be used on sponge instead of grass? Or would playing on sponge void the warranty?.i tried to escslate my call from the supervisor to his manager and the Nike Supervisor told me the managet would say the samething. The nike Supervisor said its black and white, you can either take the 20% or dont take it. Go figure. Big brand wins again...thanks for making it easier for me.R.I.P NIKE Customer from1986 to May 2016",25 May 2016,CA

Lauren untch,I've had my metcon 1s for less than a year. After only about 3 months of having them the fabric separated from the mesh. As a busy mom I just said whatever. Then 5 months I decided to contact Nike because the other side started doing the same and Nike never once responded back to my emails. Great costumer service...NOT!! Now the rubber sole on the back has separated. I switch off shoes daily and only workout indoors so they are defiantly not over worn. Bottom line is in disappointed with the quality of these shoes and the poor customer service. Looks like I'll be sticking to my Nanos and a different company!,04 May 2016,US

Nikki W.,"Unfortunately, Nike has disappointed me. I purchased a pair of tennis shoes at the beginning of April, and needless to say, I have NOT received them as of yet. Initially I had to return the shoes for a larger size, which they received back by April 7th, courtesy of an email sent to my phone from Nike, that when I called to see what the hold up was, was told by customer service that I was NEVER sent that email..... Huh? And you know that how? Anyway, my order should be here tomorrow, although, it was scheduled for delivery by today! Boy, I tell you, Nike needs to do BETTER!!!!!!!",25 April 2016,US
Danny,"I recently had my first order with Nike.com for which I ordered extra of the same items in more sizes, delivery was good and they accepted all the returns no problem.

Brian King,"My son ordered two pairs of shoes on Friday 1st April. I spoke to Helen at Nike.com to cancel one pair. On Monday 4th, I was emailed to say the shoes were due 12.49-13.49. When these didn't show, I phoned to be told that both pairs were sent and recalled! Mistakes happen.  I called Alexandria at Nike.com, who said she would refer it to the managers; who knows why??? I was told the decision took 24-48 hrs. By Saturday 9th no decision had been made. Anthony at Nike.com said there were no supervisors to speak to to escalate the issue of our order. Then, later said his supervisor would not speak to me.   I have shared this experience with others on my son's football team, and I am not alone in being disappointed. I recommend you avoid disappointment. Avoid Nike.com",09 April 2016,GB
LP,"I ordered an on sale shoe March 23, 2016 and after placing my order on Nike.com arrival said 5-9 days. It is now April 1, 2016 and still no shoe. I have contacted Nike via online chat multiple times and that was useless. I contacted them because my order, still to this day, says ""preparing to ship"". They told me they could do nothing and someone else (I don't even know who) would contact me in 1-3 days telling me my shoe statues. Still no email or shoe. I will never order online from them ever again because of how rude the chat person was and also because of the bad service. I hope other people find this review helpful because this is the worst online service I have ever gotten. Nike is a successful worldwide company and for the bad service I have received it is very disappointing.",01 April 2016,CA

In October, tabs on the sole fell off.  I contacted Nike, filed a claim, and sent them in for evaluation.  Nike disallowed the claim citing normal wear and tear.

Cameron,I'm currently serving overseas and good running shoes are a must for physical training. My old running shoes are worn out so I decided to order a new pair and due to the fact that there isn't a mall available I have to turn to Amazon to place orders. Amazon wouldn't send these particular shoes overseas and instead of just having them sent to my wife and then having her mail them to me and I'd get them in a week or two I decided to give Nike a chance and just call the online sales number. Near the end of my purchased I'm told that it may take 30-45 days to get here but was assured that it usually takes up to 2 weeks. On Nike's tracking website Nikenarvar.com they give out some USPS tracking number that isn't even a correct tracking number. I spent an hour on hold to talk to USPS just to find out there's nothing that they can do because Nike gave an invalid tracking number. In the matter of 2 days my estimated delivery time has been pushed back by 3 days and each day that I called to find out how they are getting this information if they don't even have a valid tracking number from USPS they tell me that it's just an estimated date. So your telling me that you give out fake tracking numbers along with made up delivery dates? I'd expect more from you Nike but I learned to never order your products from your website. From now on I'll stick to buying from Amazon where I'm able to track items that I spend my hard earned cash on. Forgot to mention how I've been stressing to Nike that I won't be in this country anymore near the 45 day mark and I'll be heading back to the states and their response was well if your not there then they would be sent back to us and you'd have to wait on a refund. So I'd have to wait up to 30-45 days to receive the shoes and if I'm not there anymore another 30-45 days to receive a refund and that is if Nike doesn't screw me over on a refund.,01 January 2016,KR

The ""nike air"" lettering on the back of the shoe has started to come loose on the N & I letters after a few weeks, and I didn't wear them much in that time. Nike have wasted my time for months now and still to this day have not replied to my complaint directly even after saying this info would be sent to the HQ I have also spoken to the head of customer service who said I would receive an official reply the next day but I have still heard nothing to this day!. After repeat messages to them I was also told if I was abusive or rude I would get no help.. even though I never acted in this way in being rude or abusive!!!!!!!!! This just shows they are happy to rip people off and want this to carry on so I'm publicly posting this now.  I would like Nike to rectify this as a long term loyal customer I feel cheated out of £75 at the moment.

Steve Dille,"I find when I deal with national brands that I will have a good experience on customer service if something goes wrong.  I was so wrong with Nike.  I'm not sure what causes their policies, maybe a lot of scammers trying to rip off shoes ordering online and saying they didn't get them...  But they are nasty.  Here is my story - Im in my 50s, a sophisticated online executive with graduate degree and plenty of income.   My son asked for a particular pair of Nike Jordan shoes I couldn't get at Amazon so I went to Nike.com (where I have shopped maybe 4-5 times before.)  I ordered the shoes, entered my address, paid and waited for delivery.    My son began to ask where are the shoes.  I looked it up and discovered they mailed them to an address I had 5 years ago.  Within 30 days from the order, I called their ""disservice center"" and began discussions with someone named Brian about the shoe shipment which wasted about an hour of my time over two phone calls.  I learned that ""they have a two step solid process for the customer to verify the shipment address and I am at fault for ordering the shoes and shipping them to the wrong address.""  If they could get the shoes back, then they could send me new ones.  But there is nothing they can do.  so sorry...  However, they also noticed and admitted that an invalid UPS shipment code was issued so they cant even track the order to be able to verify that the shoes where returned (geez do you think they might have screwed up the address to?).  After two calls of this nonsense and them placing me in the middle of their screwed up processes , I was done.  I told them to just return the shoes and credit my Visa.  At this point they should have just given me my money back and I would have walked away and probably gone to a nike store and bought some.  But Nike refused because they cant get them back because their system issued an invalid tracking number...  And Im supposed to sit int he middle of this and wait for another phone call and waste more time while someone tries to find the shoes...  No thanks.  I told them return them or I am getting of the phone and filing a complaint with Visa and I will not pay for something I never received....  And no I didnt not enter the new address,  I remember putting it in.  Unbelievable service for a national brand.  Most of which have great service.  I can only suspect that everyone no matter how poor or trashy needs shoes and they want Nike shoes so they probably must get a bunch of scammers trying to rip them off so they have created this nasty attitude hardline policy.  Trouble is, they need to figure out when they are dealing with someone legit vs. a scammer...  Beware...  Very messed up company and awful service.  I am now officially never buying another Nike product and I mostly wore Nike tennis gear for years....   Steve",06 November 2015,US
Tiffany yates,"Tried to order launch shoes today. Waited ""in-line""  for 10 minutes, they went in to my cart and by the time I put my shipping and billing info in they were sold. Btw it only took me 2 minutes to put all info in. Called customer service after trying again and was told they were sold out. Asked to speak to supervisor and was told there wasn't any there at the time but they would have them return my call. Called back later and the employee was rude but told me supervisors were there and to hold for a second they would get them for me. Said employee gets back on the phone and says they're busy and that there was nothing they could do anyway. After I proceeded to tell the employee that was bad customer service and I thought it was ridiculous was then asked to hold again and she would see about getting he supervisor again. Waited on hold for 30 minutes before I just hung up! The worst customer service I have EVER experienced. I would not recommend anyone shopping with them!",30 October 2015,US
Christina Andrews,"I tried yesterday to make a very simple purchase of two pairs of shoes for my son. No sooner had I hit ""submit"" than I realized there was a typo on my shipping/billing address. I immediately (and I mean within 30 seconds) I called the 800 # and was told that it was too late to fix the address, too late to cancel the order and that they would not issue a refund. The order was going to get delivered to a non-existent address and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. I was furious... $237 for NOTHING. After my blood pressure went down, I called back (still within 20 minutes of the purchase online). I asked to speak to a manager... not possible. Trying chatting with Kathryn online. She was unpleasant, unhelpful, couldn't do anything about it. Long and short of it... be very, very careful when you order from Nike. They will not be able to correct any errors, no matter how quickly you call, they will not issue a refund and they will lie to you. They told me they had not charged my card, yet the full amount had been taken from my account. They said they could issue a refund, could not fix the address, could not provide me with the tracking information on the shipment, NOTHING.

Contacted Nike for an exchange, which was not permitted without me either returning my shoes first or ordering a new pair and then returning the defective ones. I eventually agreed to this, but waited forever. Turned out they were out of stock at Nike.com, so nobody could even complete my order. Three weeks later, a rep tried to help me get in touch with an outlet store for the shoes since they had them in stock, but the coupon code I used was no longer valid.
